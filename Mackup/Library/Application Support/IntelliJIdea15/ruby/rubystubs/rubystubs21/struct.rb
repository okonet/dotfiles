# A Struct is a convenient way to bundle a number of attributes together,
# using accessor methods, without having to write an explicit class.
# 
# The Struct class generates new subclasses that hold a set of members and
# their values.  For each member a reader and writer method is created
# similar to Module#attr_accessor.
# 
#    Customer = Struct.new(:name, :address) do
#      def greeting
#        "Hello #{name}!"
#      end
#    end
# 
#    dave = Customer.new("Dave", "123 Main")
#    dave.name     #=> "Dave"
#    dave.greeting #=> "Hello Dave!"
# 
# See Struct::new for further examples of creating struct subclasses and
# instances.
# 
# In the method descriptions that follow a "member" parameter refers to a
# struct member which is either a quoted string (<code>"name"</code>) or a
# Symbol (<code>:name</code>).

    #  
    # The first two forms are used to create a new Struct subclass +class_name+
    # that can contain a value for each +member_name+.  This subclass can be
    # used to create instances of the structure like any other Class.
    # 
    # If the +class_name+ is omitted an anonymous structure class will be
    # created.  Otherwise, the name of this struct will appear as a constant in
    # class Struct, so it must be unique for all Structs in the system and
    # must start with a capital letter.  Assigning a structure class to a
    # constant also gives the class the name of the constant.
    # 
    #    # Create a structure with a name under Struct
    #    Struct.new("Customer", :name, :address)
    #    #=> Struct::Customer
    #    Struct::Customer.new("Dave", "123 Main")
    #    #=> #<struct Struct::Customer name="Dave", address="123 Main">
    # 
    # If a block is given it will be evaluated in the context of
    # +StructClass+, passing the created class as a parameter:
    # 
    #    Customer = Struct.new(:name, :address) do
    #      def greeting
    #        "Hello #{name}!"
    #      end
    #    end
    #    Customer.new("Dave", "123 Main").greeting  # => "Hello Dave!"
    # 
    # This is the recommended way to customize a struct.  Subclassing an
    # anonymous struct creates an extra anonymous class that will never be used.
    # 
    # The last two forms create a new instance of a struct subclass.  The number
    # of +value+ parameters must be less than or equal to the number of
    # attributes defined for the structure.  Unset parameters default to +nil+.
    # Passing more parameters than number of attributes will raise
    # an ArgumentError.
    # 
    #    # Create a structure named by its constant
    #    Customer = Struct.new(:name, :address)
    #    #=> Customer
