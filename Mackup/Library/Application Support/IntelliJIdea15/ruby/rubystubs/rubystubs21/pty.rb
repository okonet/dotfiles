# Creates and managed pseudo terminals (PTYs).  See also
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_terminal
# 
# PTY allows you to allocate new terminals using ::open or ::spawn a new
# terminal with a specific command.
# 
# == Example
# 
# In this example we will change the buffering type in the +factor+ command,
# assuming that factor uses stdio for stdout buffering.
# 
# If IO.pipe is used instead of PTY.open, this code deadlocks because factor's
# stdout is fully buffered.
# 
#   # start by requiring the standard library PTY
#   require 'pty'
# 
#   master, slave = PTY.open
#   read, write = IO.pipe
#   pid = spawn("factor", :in=>read, :out=>slave)
#   read.close     # we dont need the read
#   slave.close    # or the slave
# 
#   # pipe "42" to the factor command
#   write.puts "42"
#   # output the response from factor
#   p master.gets #=> "42: 2 3 7\n"
# 
#   # pipe "144" to factor and print out the response
#   write.puts "144"
#   p master.gets #=> "144: 2 2 2 2 3 3\n"
#   write.close # close the pipe
# 
#   # The result of read operation when pty slave is closed is platform
#   # dependent.
#   ret = begin
#           m.gets          # FreeBSD returns nil.
#         rescue Errno::EIO # GNU/Linux raises EIO.
#           nil
#         end
#   p ret #=> nil
