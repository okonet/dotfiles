# The ObjectSpace module contains a number of routines
# that interact with the garbage collection facility and allow you to
# traverse all living objects with an iterator.
# 
# ObjectSpace also provides support for object finalizers, procs that will be
# called when a specific object is about to be destroyed by garbage
# collection.
# 
#    a = "A"
#    b = "B"

#    ObjectSpace.define_finalizer(a, proc {|id| puts "Finalizer one on #{id}" })

# The objspace library extends the ObjectSpace module and adds several
# methods to get internal statistic information about
# object/memory management.
# 
# You need to <code>require 'objspace'</code> to use this extension module.
# 
# Generally, you *SHOULD NOT* use this library if you do not know
# about the MRI implementation.  Mainly, this library is for (memory)
# profiler developers and MRI developers who need to know about MRI
# memory usage.
module ObjectSpace
    # ObjectSpace.each_object([module]) {|obj| ... } -> fixnum
    # ObjectSpace.each_object([module])              -> an_enumerator
    #  
    # Calls the block once for each living, nonimmediate object in this
    # Ruby process. If <i>module</i> is specified, calls the block
    # for only those classes or modules that match (or are a subclass of)
    # <i>module</i>. Returns the number of objects found. Immediate
    # objects (<code>Fixnum</code>s, <code>Symbol</code>s
    # <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and <code>nil</code>) are
    # never returned. In the example below, <code>each_object</code>
    # returns both the numbers we defined and several constants defined in
    # the <code>Math</code> module.
    # 
    # If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.
