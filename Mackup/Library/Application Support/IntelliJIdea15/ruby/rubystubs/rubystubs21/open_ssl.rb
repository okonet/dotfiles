# OpenSSL provides SSL, TLS and general purpose cryptography.  It wraps the
# OpenSSL[http://www.openssl.org/] library.
# 
# = Examples
# 
# All examples assume you have loaded OpenSSL with:
# 
#   require 'openssl'
# 
# These examples build atop each other.  For example the key created in the
# next is used in throughout these examples.
# 
# == Keys
# 
# === Creating a Key
# 
# This example creates a 2048 bit RSA keypair and writes it to the current
# directory.
# 
#   key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new 2048
# 
#   open 'private_key.pem', 'w' do |io| io.write key.to_pem end
#   open 'public_key.pem', 'w' do |io| io.write key.public_key.to_pem end
# 
# === Exporting a Key
# 
# Keys saved to disk without encryption are not secure as anyone who gets
# ahold of the key may use it unless it is encrypted.  In order to securely
# export a key you may export it with a pass phrase.
# 
#   cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher.new 'AES-128-CBC'
#   pass_phrase = 'my secure pass phrase goes here'
# 
#   key_secure = key.export cipher, pass_phrase
# 
#   open 'private.secure.pem', 'w' do |io|
#     io.write key_secure
#   end
# 
# OpenSSL::Cipher.ciphers returns a list of available ciphers.
# 
# === Loading a Key
# 
# A key can also be loaded from a file.
# 
#   key2 = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new File.read 'private_key.pem'
#   key2.public? # => true
# 
# or
# 
#   key3 = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new File.read 'public_key.pem'
#   key3.private? # => false
# 
# === Loading an Encrypted Key
# 
# OpenSSL will prompt you for your pass phrase when loading an encrypted key.
# If you will not be able to type in the pass phrase you may provide it when
# loading the key:
# 
#   key4_pem = File.read 'private.secure.pem'
#   key4 = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new key4_pem, pass_phrase
# 
# == RSA Encryption
# 
# RSA provides encryption and decryption using the public and private keys.
# You can use a variety of padding methods depending upon the intended use of
# encrypted data.
# 
# === Encryption & Decryption
# 
# Asymmetric public/private key encryption is slow and victim to attack in
# cases where it is used without padding or directly to encrypt larger chunks
# of data. Typical use cases for RSA encryption involve "wrapping" a symmetric
# key with the public key of the recipient who would "unwrap" that symmetric
# key again using their private key.
# The following illustrates a simplified example of such a key transport
# scheme. It shouldn't be used in practice, though, standardized protocols
# should always be preferred.
# 
#   wrapped_key = key.public_encrypt key
# 
# A symmetric key encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with
# the corresponding private key of the recipient.
# 
#   original_key = key.private_decrypt wrapped_key
# 
# By default PKCS#1 padding will be used, but it is also possible to use
# other forms of padding, see PKey::RSA for further details.
# 
# === Signatures
# 
# Using "private_encrypt" to encrypt some data with the private key is
# equivalent to applying a digital signature to the data. A verifying
# party may validate the signature by comparing the result of decrypting
# the signature with "public_decrypt" to the original data. However,
# OpenSSL::PKey already has methods "sign" and "verify" that handle
# digital signatures in a standardized way - "private_encrypt" and
# "public_decrypt" shouldn't be used in practice.
# 
# To sign a document, a cryptographically secure hash of the document is
# computed first, which is then signed using the private key.
# 
#   digest = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256.new
#   signature = key.sign digest, document
# 
# To validate the signature, again a hash of the document is computed and
# the signature is decrypted using the public key. The result is then
# compared to the hash just computed, if they are equal the signature was
# valid.
# 
#   digest = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256.new
#   if key.verify digest, signature, document
#     puts 'Valid'
#   else
#     puts 'Invalid'
#   end
# 
# == PBKDF2 Password-based Encryption
# 
# If supported by the underlying OpenSSL version used, Password-based
# Encryption should use the features of PKCS5. If not supported or if
# required by legacy applications, the older, less secure methods specified
# in RFC 2898 are also supported (see below).
# 
# PKCS5 supports PBKDF2 as it was specified in PKCS#5
# v2.0[http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2127]. It still uses a
# password, a salt, and additionally a number of iterations that will
# slow the key derivation process down. The slower this is, the more work
# it requires being able to brute-force the resulting key.
# 
# === Encryption
# 
# The strategy is to first instantiate a Cipher for encryption, and
# then to generate a random IV plus a key derived from the password
# using PBKDF2. PKCS #5 v2.0 recommends at least 8 bytes for the salt,
# the number of iterations largely depends on the hardware being used.
# 
#   cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher.new 'AES-128-CBC'
#   cipher.encrypt
#   iv = cipher.random_iv
# 
#   pwd = 'some hopefully not to easily guessable password'
#   salt = OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes 16
#   iter = 20000
#   key_len = cipher.key_len
#   digest = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256.new
# 
#   key = OpenSSL::PKCS5.pbkdf2_hmac(pwd, salt, iter, key_len, digest)
#   cipher.key = key
# 
#   Now encrypt the data:
# 
#   encrypted = cipher.update document
#   encrypted << cipher.final
# 
# === Decryption
# 
# Use the same steps as before to derive the symmetric AES key, this time
# setting the Cipher up for decryption.
# 
#   cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher.new 'AES-128-CBC'
#   cipher.decrypt
#   cipher.iv = iv # the one generated with #random_iv
# 
#   pwd = 'some hopefully not to easily guessable password'
#   salt = ... # the one generated above
#   iter = 20000
#   key_len = cipher.key_len
#   digest = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256.new
# 
#   key = OpenSSL::PKCS5.pbkdf2_hmac(pwd, salt, iter, key_len, digest)
#   cipher.key = key
# 
#   Now decrypt the data:
# 
#   decrypted = cipher.update encrypted
#   decrypted << cipher.final
# 
# == PKCS #5 Password-based Encryption
# 
# PKCS #5 is a password-based encryption standard documented at
# RFC2898[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt].  It allows a short password or
# passphrase to be used to create a secure encryption key. If possible, PBKDF2
# as described above should be used if the circumstances allow it.
# 
# PKCS #5 uses a Cipher, a pass phrase and a salt to generate an encryption
# key.
# 
#   pass_phrase = 'my secure pass phrase goes here'
#   salt = '8 octets'
# 
# === Encryption
# 
# First set up the cipher for encryption
# 
#   encrypter = OpenSSL::Cipher.new 'AES-128-CBC'
#   encrypter.encrypt
#   encrypter.pkcs5_keyivgen pass_phrase, salt
# 
# Then pass the data you want to encrypt through
# 
#   encrypted = encrypter.update 'top secret document'
#   encrypted << encrypter.final
# 
# === Decryption
# 
# Use a new Cipher instance set up for decryption
# 
#   decrypter = OpenSSL::Cipher.new 'AES-128-CBC'
#   decrypter.decrypt
#   decrypter.pkcs5_keyivgen pass_phrase, salt
# 
# Then pass the data you want to decrypt through
# 
#   plain = decrypter.update encrypted
#   plain << decrypter.final
# 
# == X509 Certificates
# 
# === Creating a Certificate
# 
# This example creates a self-signed certificate using an RSA key and a SHA1
# signature.
# 
#   name = OpenSSL::X509::Name.parse 'CN=nobody/DC=example'
# 
#   cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new
#   cert.version = 2
#   cert.serial = 0
#   cert.not_before = Time.now
#   cert.not_after = Time.now + 3600
# 
#   cert.public_key = key.public_key
#   cert.subject = name
# 
# === Certificate Extensions
# 
# You can add extensions to the certificate with
# OpenSSL::SSL::ExtensionFactory to indicate the purpose of the certificate.
# 
#   extension_factory = OpenSSL::X509::ExtensionFactory.new nil, cert
# 
#   cert.add_extension \
#     extension_factory.create_extension('basicConstraints', 'CA:FALSE', true)
# 
#   cert.add_extension \
#     extension_factory.create_extension(
#       'keyUsage', 'keyEncipherment,dataEncipherment,digitalSignature')
# 
#   cert.add_extension \
#     extension_factory.create_extension('subjectKeyIdentifier', 'hash')
# 
# The list of supported extensions (and in some cases their possible values)
# can be derived from the "objects.h" file in the OpenSSL source code.
# 
# === Signing a Certificate
# 
# To sign a certificate set the issuer and use OpenSSL::X509::Certificate#sign
# with a digest algorithm.  This creates a self-signed cert because we're using
# the same name and key to sign the certificate as was used to create the
# certificate.
# 
#   cert.issuer = name
#   cert.sign key, OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1.new
# 
#   open 'certificate.pem', 'w' do |io| io.write cert.to_pem end
# 
# === Loading a Certificate
# 
# Like a key, a cert can also be loaded from a file.
# 
#   cert2 = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new File.read 'certificate.pem'
# 
# === Verifying a Certificate
# 
# Certificate#verify will return true when a certificate was signed with the
# given public key.
# 
#   raise 'certificate can not be verified' unless cert2.verify key
# 
# == Certificate Authority
# 
# A certificate authority (CA) is a trusted third party that allows you to
# verify the ownership of unknown certificates.  The CA issues key signatures
# that indicate it trusts the user of that key.  A user encountering the key
# can verify the signature by using the CA's public key.
# 
# === CA Key
# 
# CA keys are valuable, so we encrypt and save it to disk and make sure it is
# not readable by other users.
# 
#   ca_key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new 2048
# 
#   cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::Cipher.new 'AES-128-CBC'
# 
#   open 'ca_key.pem', 'w', 0400 do |io|
#     io.write ca_key.export(cipher, pass_phrase)
#   end
# 
# === CA Certificate
# 
# A CA certificate is created the same way we created a certificate above, but
# with different extensions.
# 
#   ca_name = OpenSSL::X509::Name.parse 'CN=ca/DC=example'
# 
#   ca_cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new
#   ca_cert.serial = 0
#   ca_cert.version = 2
#   ca_cert.not_before = Time.now
#   ca_cert.not_after = Time.now + 86400
# 
#   ca_cert.public_key = ca_key.public_key
#   ca_cert.subject = ca_name
#   ca_cert.issuer = ca_name
# 
#   extension_factory = OpenSSL::X509::ExtensionFactory.new
#   extension_factory.subject_certificate = ca_cert
#   extension_factory.issuer_certificate = ca_cert
# 
#   ca_cert.add_extension \
#     extension_factory.create_extension('subjectKeyIdentifier', 'hash')
# 
# This extension indicates the CA's key may be used as a CA.
# 
#   ca_cert.add_extension \
#     extension_factory.create_extension('basicConstraints', 'CA:TRUE', true)
# 
# This extension indicates the CA's key may be used to verify signatures on
# both certificates and certificate revocations.
# 
#   ca_cert.add_extension \
#     extension_factory.create_extension(
#       'keyUsage', 'cRLSign,keyCertSign', true)
# 
# Root CA certificates are self-signed.
# 
#   ca_cert.sign ca_key, OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1.new
# 
# The CA certificate is saved to disk so it may be distributed to all the
# users of the keys this CA will sign.
# 
#   open 'ca_cert.pem', 'w' do |io|
#     io.write ca_cert.to_pem
#   end
# 
# === Certificate Signing Request
# 
# The CA signs keys through a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).  The CSR
# contains the information necessary to identify the key.
# 
#   csr = OpenSSL::X509::Request.new
#   csr.version = 0
#   csr.subject = name
#   csr.public_key = key.public_key
#   csr.sign key, OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1.new
# 
# A CSR is saved to disk and sent to the CA for signing.
# 
#   open 'csr.pem', 'w' do |io|
#     io.write csr.to_pem
#   end
# 
# === Creating a Certificate from a CSR
# 
# Upon receiving a CSR the CA will verify it before signing it.  A minimal
# verification would be to check the CSR's signature.
# 
#   csr = OpenSSL::X509::Request.new File.read 'csr.pem'
# 
#   raise 'CSR can not be verified' unless csr.verify csr.public_key
# 
# After verification a certificate is created, marked for various usages,
# signed with the CA key and returned to the requester.
# 
#   csr_cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new
#   csr_cert.serial = 0
#   csr_cert.version = 2
#   csr_cert.not_before = Time.now
#   csr_cert.not_after = Time.now + 600
# 
#   csr_cert.subject = csr.subject
#   csr_cert.public_key = csr.public_key
#   csr_cert.issuer = ca_cert.subject
# 
#   extension_factory = OpenSSL::X509::ExtensionFactory.new
#   extension_factory.subject_certificate = csr_cert
#   extension_factory.issuer_certificate = ca_cert
# 
#   csr_cert.add_extension \
#     extension_factory.create_extension('basicConstraints', 'CA:FALSE')
# 
#   csr_cert.add_extension \
#     extension_factory.create_extension(
#       'keyUsage', 'keyEncipherment,dataEncipherment,digitalSignature')
# 
#   csr_cert.add_extension \
#     extension_factory.create_extension('subjectKeyIdentifier', 'hash')
# 
#   csr_cert.sign ca_key, OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1.new
# 
#   open 'csr_cert.pem', 'w' do |io|
#     io.write csr_cert.to_pem
#   end
# 
# == SSL and TLS Connections
# 
# Using our created key and certificate we can create an SSL or TLS connection.
# An SSLContext is used to set up an SSL session.
# 
#   context = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext.new
# 
# === SSL Server
# 
# An SSL server requires the certificate and private key to communicate
# securely with its clients:
# 
#   context.cert = cert
#   context.key = key
# 
# Then create an SSLServer with a TCP server socket and the context.  Use the
# SSLServer like an ordinary TCP server.
# 
#   require 'socket'
# 
#   tcp_server = TCPServer.new 5000
#   ssl_server = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLServer.new tcp_server, context
# 
#   loop do
#     ssl_connection = ssl_server.accept
# 
#     data = connection.gets
# 
#     response = "I got #{data.dump}"
#     puts response
# 
#     connection.puts "I got #{data.dump}"
#     connection.close
#   end
# 
# === SSL client
# 
# An SSL client is created with a TCP socket and the context.
# SSLSocket#connect must be called to initiate the SSL handshake and start
# encryption.  A key and certificate are not required for the client socket.
# 
#   require 'socket'
# 
#   tcp_client = TCPSocket.new 'localhost', 5000
#   ssl_client = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.new client_socket, context
#   ssl_client.connect
# 
#   ssl_client.puts "hello server!"
#   puts ssl_client.gets
# 
# === Peer Verification
# 
# An unverified SSL connection does not provide much security.  For enhanced
# security the client or server can verify the certificate of its peer.
# 
# The client can be modified to verify the server's certificate against the
# certificate authority's certificate:
# 
#   context.ca_file = 'ca_cert.pem'
#   context.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER
# 
#   require 'socket'
# 
#   tcp_client = TCPSocket.new 'localhost', 5000
#   ssl_client = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.new client_socket, context
#   ssl_client.connect
# 
#   ssl_client.puts "hello server!"
#   puts ssl_client.gets
# 
# If the server certificate is invalid or <tt>context.ca_file</tt> is not set
# when verifying peers an OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError will be raised.

    # Abstract Syntax Notation One (or ASN.1) is a notation syntax to
    # describe data structures and is defined in ITU-T X.680. ASN.1 itself
    # does not mandate any encoding or parsing rules, but usually ASN.1 data
    # structures are encoded using the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) or
    # less often the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) described in ITU-T X.690. DER
    # and BER encodings are binary Tag-Length-Value (TLV) encodings that are
    # quite concise compared to other popular data description formats such
    # as XML, JSON etc.
    # ASN.1 data structures are very common in cryptographic applications,
    # e.g. X.509 public key certificates or certificate revocation lists
    # (CRLs) are all defined in ASN.1 and DER-encoded. ASN.1, DER and BER are
    # the building blocks of applied cryptography.
    # The ASN1 module provides the necessary classes that allow generation
    # of ASN.1 data structures and the methods to encode them using a DER
    # encoding. The decode method allows parsing arbitrary BER-/DER-encoded
    # data to a Ruby object that can then be modified and re-encoded at will.
    # 
    # == ASN.1 class hierarchy
    # 
    # The base class representing ASN.1 structures is ASN1Data. ASN1Data offers
    # attributes to read and set the +tag+, the +tag_class+ and finally the
    # +value+ of a particular ASN.1 item. Upon parsing, any tagged values
    # (implicit or explicit) will be represented by ASN1Data instances because
    # their "real type" can only be determined using out-of-band information
    # from the ASN.1 type declaration. Since this information is normally
    # known when encoding a type, all sub-classes of ASN1Data offer an
    # additional attribute +tagging+ that allows to encode a value implicitly
    # (+:IMPLICIT+) or explicitly (+:EXPLICIT+).
    # 
    # === Constructive
    # 
    # Constructive is, as its name implies, the base class for all
    # constructed encodings, i.e. those that consist of several values,
    # opposed to "primitive" encodings with just one single value.
    # Primitive values that are encoded with "infinite length" are typically
    # constructed (their values come in multiple chunks) and are therefore
    # represented by instances of Constructive. The value of an Constructive
    # is always an Array.
    # 
    # ==== ASN1::Set and ASN1::Sequence
    # 
    # The most common constructive encodings are SETs and SEQUENCEs, which is
    # why there are two sub-classes of Constructive representing each of
    # them.
    # 
    # === Primitive
    # 
    # This is the super class of all primitive values. Primitive
    # itself is not used when parsing ASN.1 data, all values are either
    # instances of a corresponding sub-class of Primitive or they are
    # instances of ASN1Data if the value was tagged implicitly or explicitly.
    # Please cf. Primitive documentation for details on sub-classes and
    # their respective mappings of ASN.1 data types to Ruby objects.
    # 
    # == Possible values for +tagging+
    # 
    # When constructing an ASN1Data object the ASN.1 type definition may
    # require certain elements to be either implicitly or explicitly tagged.
    # This can be achieved by setting the +tagging+ attribute manually for
    # sub-classes of ASN1Data. Use the symbol +:IMPLICIT+ for implicit
    # tagging and +:EXPLICIT+ if the element requires explicit tagging.
    # 
    # == Possible values for +tag_class+
    # 
    # It is possible to create arbitrary ASN1Data objects that also support
    # a PRIVATE or APPLICATION tag class. Possible values for the +tag_class+
    # attribute are:
    # * +:UNIVERSAL+ (the default for untagged values)
    # * +:CONTEXT_SPECIFIC+ (the default for tagged values)
    # * +:APPLICATION+
    # * +:PRIVATE+
    # 
    # == Tag constants
    # 
    # There is a constant defined for each universal tag:
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::EOC (0)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::BOOLEAN (1)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::INTEGER (2)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::BIT_STRING (3)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::OCTET_STRING (4)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::NULL (5)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::OBJECT (6)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::ENUMERATED (10)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::UTF8STRING (12)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::SEQUENCE (16)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::SET (17)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::NUMERICSTRING (18)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::PRINTABLESTRING (19)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::T61STRING (20)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::VIDEOTEXSTRING (21)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::IA5STRING (22)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::UTCTIME (23)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::GENERALIZEDTIME (24)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::GRAPHICSTRING (25)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::ISO64STRING (26)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::GENERALSTRING (27)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::UNIVERSALSTRING (28)
    # * OpenSSL::ASN1::BMPSTRING (30)
    # 
    # == UNIVERSAL_TAG_NAME constant
    # 
    # An Array that stores the name of a given tag number. These names are
    # the same as the name of the tag constant that is additionally defined,
    # e.g. UNIVERSAL_TAG_NAME[2] = "INTEGER" and OpenSSL::ASN1::INTEGER = 2.
    # 
    # == Example usage
    # 
    # === Decoding and viewing a DER-encoded file
    #   require 'openssl'
    #   require 'pp'
    #   der = File.binread('data.der')
    #   asn1 = OpenSSL::ASN1.decode(der)

        # The top-level class representing any ASN.1 object. When parsed by
        # ASN1.decode, tagged values are always represented by an instance
        # of ASN1Data.
        # 
        # == The role of ASN1Data for parsing tagged values
        # 
        # When encoding an ASN.1 type it is inherently clear what original
        # type (e.g. INTEGER, OCTET STRING etc.) this value has, regardless
        # of its tagging.
        # But opposed to the time an ASN.1 type is to be encoded, when parsing
        # them it is not possible to deduce the "real type" of tagged
        # values. This is why tagged values are generally parsed into ASN1Data
        # instances, but with a different outcome for implicit and explicit
        # tagging.
        # 
        # === Example of a parsed implicitly tagged value
        # 
        # An implicitly 1-tagged INTEGER value will be parsed as an
        # ASN1Data with
        # * +tag+ equal to 1
        # * +tag_class+ equal to +:CONTEXT_SPECIFIC+
        # * +value+ equal to a +String+ that carries the raw encoding
        #   of the INTEGER.
        # This implies that a subsequent decoding step is required to
        # completely decode implicitly tagged values.
        # 
        # === Example of a parsed explicitly tagged value
        # 
        # An explicitly 1-tagged INTEGER value will be parsed as an
        # ASN1Data with
        # * +tag+ equal to 1
        # * +tag_class+ equal to +:CONTEXT_SPECIFIC+
        # * +value+ equal to an +Array+ with one single element, an
        #   instance of OpenSSL::ASN1::Integer, i.e. the inner element
        #   is the non-tagged primitive value, and the tagging is represented
        #   in the outer ASN1Data
        # 
        # == Example - Decoding an implicitly tagged INTEGER
        #   int = OpenSSL::ASN1::Integer.new(1, 0, :IMPLICIT) # implicit 0-tagged

        # == SET and SEQUENCE
        #

        # These encodings are represented by one of the two sub-classes of
        # Constructive:
        # * OpenSSL::ASN1::Set
        # * OpenSSL::ASN1::Sequence
        # Please note that tagged sequences and sets are still parsed as
        # instances of ASN1Data. Find further details on tagged values
        # there.
        # 
        # === Example - constructing a SEQUENCE
        #   int = OpenSSL::ASN1::Integer.new(1)
        #   str = OpenSSL::ASN1::PrintableString.new('abc')
        #   sequence = OpenSSL::ASN1::Sequence.new( [ int, str ] )
        # 
        # === Example - constructing a SET
        #   int = OpenSSL::ASN1::Integer.new(1)
        #   str = OpenSSL::ASN1::PrintableString.new('abc')
        #   set = OpenSSL::ASN1::Set.new( [ int, str ] )
        # 
        # == Infinite length primitive values
        # 
        # The only case where Constructive is used directly is for infinite
        # length encodings of primitive values. These encodings are always
        # constructed, with the contents of the +value+ +Array+ being either
        # UNIVERSAL non-infinite length partial encodings of the actual value
        # or again constructive encodings with infinite length (i.e. infinite
        # length primitive encodings may be constructed recursively with another
        # infinite length value within an already infinite length value). Each
        # partial encoding must be of the same UNIVERSAL type as the overall
        # encoding. The value of the overall encoding consists of the
        # concatenation of each partial encoding taken in sequence. The +value+
        # array of the outer infinite length value must end with a
        # OpenSSL::ASN1::EndOfContent instance.
        # 
        # Please note that it is not possible to encode Constructive without
        # the +infinite_length+ attribute being set to +true+, use
        # OpenSSL::ASN1::Sequence or OpenSSL::ASN1::Set in these cases instead.
        # 
        # === Example - Infinite length OCTET STRING
        #   partial1 = OpenSSL::ASN1::OctetString.new("\x01")
        #   partial2 = OpenSSL::ASN1::OctetString.new("\x02")

    # Provides symmetric algorithms for encryption and decryption. The
    # algorithms that are available depend on the particular version
    # of OpenSSL that is installed.
    # 
    # === Listing all supported algorithms
    # 
    # A list of supported algorithms can be obtained by
    # 
    #   puts OpenSSL::Cipher.ciphers
    # 
    # === Instantiating a Cipher
    # 
    # There are several ways to create a Cipher instance. Generally, a
    # Cipher algorithm is categorized by its name, the key length in bits
    # and the cipher mode to be used. The most generic way to create a
    # Cipher is the following
    # 
    #   cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher.new('<name>-<key length>-<mode>')
    # 
    # That is, a string consisting of the hyphenated concatenation of the
    # individual components name, key length and mode. Either all uppercase
    # or all lowercase strings may be used, for example:
    # 
    #  cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher.new('AES-128-CBC')
    # 
    # For each algorithm supported, there is a class defined under the
    # Cipher class that goes by the name of the cipher, e.g. to obtain an
    # instance of AES, you could also use
    # 
    #   # these are equivalent
    #   cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES.new(128, :CBC)
    #   cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES.new(128, 'CBC')
    #   cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES.new('128-CBC')
    # 
    # Finally, due to its wide-spread use, there are also extra classes
    # defined for the different key sizes of AES
    # 
    #   cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES128.new(:CBC)
    #   cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES192.new(:CBC)
    #   cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES256.new(:CBC)
    # 
    # === Choosing either encryption or decryption mode
    # 
    # Encryption and decryption are often very similar operations for
    # symmetric algorithms, this is reflected by not having to choose
    # different classes for either operation, both can be done using the
    # same class. Still, after obtaining a Cipher instance, we need to
    # tell the instance what it is that we intend to do with it, so we
    # need to call either
    # 
    #   cipher.encrypt
    # 
    # or
    # 
    #   cipher.decrypt
    # 
    # on the Cipher instance. This should be the first call after creating
    # the instance, otherwise configuration that has already been set could
    # get lost in the process.
    # 
    # === Choosing a key
    # 
    # Symmetric encryption requires a key that is the same for the encrypting
    # and for the decrypting party and after initial key establishment should
    # be kept as private information. There are a lot of ways to create
    # insecure keys, the most notable is to simply take a password as the key
    # without processing the password further. A simple and secure way to
    # create a key for a particular Cipher is
    # 
    #  cipher = OpenSSL::AES256.new(:CFB)
    #  cipher.encrypt
    #  key = cipher.random_key # also sets the generated key on the Cipher
    # 
    # If you absolutely need to use passwords as encryption keys, you
    # should use Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) by
    # generating the key with the help of the functionality provided by
    # OpenSSL::PKCS5.pbkdf2_hmac_sha1 or OpenSSL::PKCS5.pbkdf2_hmac.
    # 
    # Although there is Cipher#pkcs5_keyivgen, its use is deprecated and
    # it should only be used in legacy applications because it does not use
    # the newer PKCS#5 v2 algorithms.
    # 
    # === Choosing an IV
    # 
    # The cipher modes CBC, CFB, OFB and CTR all need an "initialization
    # vector", or short, IV. ECB mode is the only mode that does not require
    # an IV, but there is almost no legitimate use case for this mode
    # because of the fact that it does not sufficiently hide plaintext
    # patterns. Therefore
    # 
    # <b>You should never use ECB mode unless you are absolutely sure that
    # you absolutely need it</b>
    # 
    # Because of this, you will end up with a mode that explicitly requires
    # an IV in any case. Note that for backwards compatibility reasons,
    # setting an IV is not explicitly mandated by the Cipher API. If not
    # set, OpenSSL itself defaults to an all-zeroes IV ("\\0", not the
    # character). Although the IV can be seen as public information, i.e.
    # it may be transmitted in public once generated, it should still stay
    # unpredictable to prevent certain kinds of attacks. Therefore, ideally
    # 
    # <b>Always create a secure random IV for every encryption of your
    # Cipher</b>
    # 
    # A new, random IV should be created for every encryption of data. Think
    # of the IV as a nonce (number used once) - it's public but random and
    # unpredictable. A secure random IV can be created as follows
    # 
    #  cipher = ...
    #  cipher.encrypt
    #  key = cipher.random_key
    #  iv = cipher.random_iv # also sets the generated IV on the Cipher
    # 
    #  Although the key is generally a random value, too, it is a bad choice
    #  as an IV. There are elaborate ways how an attacker can take advantage
    #  of such an IV. As a general rule of thumb, exposing the key directly
    #  or indirectly should be avoided at all cost and exceptions only be
    #  made with good reason.
    # 
    # === Calling Cipher#final
    # 
    # ECB (which should not be used) and CBC are both block-based modes.
    # This means that unlike for the other streaming-based modes, they
    # operate on fixed-size blocks of data, and therefore they require a
    # "finalization" step to produce or correctly decrypt the last block of
    # data by appropriately handling some form of padding. Therefore it is
    # essential to add the output of OpenSSL::Cipher#final to your
    # encryption/decryption buffer or you will end up with decryption errors
    # or truncated data.
    # 
    # Although this is not really necessary for streaming-mode ciphers, it is
    # still recommended to apply the same pattern of adding the output of
    # Cipher#final there as well - it also enables you to switch between
    # modes more easily in the future.
    # 
    # === Encrypting and decrypting some data
    # 
    #   data = "Very, very confidential data"
    # 
    #   cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES.new(128, :CBC)
    #   cipher.encrypt
    #   key = cipher.random_key
    #   iv = cipher.random_iv
    # 
    #   encrypted = cipher.update(data) + cipher.final
    #   ...
    #   decipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES.new(128, :CBC)
    #   decipher.decrypt
    #   decipher.key = key
    #   decipher.iv = iv
    # 
    #   plain = decipher.update(encrypted) + decipher.final
    # 
    #   puts data == plain #=> true
    # 
    # === Authenticated Encryption and Associated Data (AEAD)
    # 
    # If the OpenSSL version used supports it, an Authenticated Encryption
    # mode (such as GCM or CCM) should always be preferred over any
    # unauthenticated mode. Currently, OpenSSL supports AE only in combination
    # with Associated Data (AEAD) where additional associated data is included
    # in the encryption process to compute a tag at the end of the encryption.
    # This tag will also be used in the decryption process and by verifying
    # its validity, the authenticity of a given ciphertext is established.
    # 
    # This is superior to unauthenticated modes in that it allows to detect
    # if somebody effectively changed the ciphertext after it had been
    # encrypted. This prevents malicious modifications of the ciphertext that
    # could otherwise be exploited to modify ciphertexts in ways beneficial to
    # potential attackers.
    # 
    # If no associated data is needed for encryption and later decryption,
    # the OpenSSL library still requires a value to be set - "" may be used in
    # case none is available. An example using the GCM (Galois Counter Mode):
    # 
    #   cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES.new(128, :GCM)
    #   cipher.encrypt
    #   key = cipher.random_key
    #   iv = cipher.random_iv
    #   cipher.auth_data = ""
    # 
    #   encrypted = cipher.update(data) + cipher.final
    #   tag = cipher.auth_tag
    # 
    #   decipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES.new(128, :GCM)
    #   decipher.decrypt
    #   decipher.key = key
    #   decipher.iv = iv
    #   decipher.auth_tag = tag
    #   decipher.auth_data = ""
    # 
    #   plain = decipher.update(encrypted) + decipher.final
    # 
    #   puts data == plain #=> true

    # OpenSSL::Digest allows you to compute message digests (sometimes
    # interchangeably called "hashes") of arbitrary data that are
    # cryptographically secure, i.e. a Digest implements a secure one-way
    # function.
    # 
    # One-way functions offer some useful properties. E.g. given two
    # distinct inputs the probability that both yield the same output
    # is highly unlikely. Combined with the fact that every message digest
    # algorithm has a fixed-length output of just a few bytes, digests are
    # often used to create unique identifiers for arbitrary data. A common
    # example is the creation of a unique id for binary documents that are
    # stored in a database.
    # 
    # Another useful characteristic of one-way functions (and thus the name)
    # is that given a digest there is no indication about the original
    # data that produced it, i.e. the only way to identify the original input
    # is to "brute-force" through every possible combination of inputs.
    # 
    # These characteristics make one-way functions also ideal companions
    # for public key signature algorithms: instead of signing an entire
    # document, first a hash of the document is produced with a considerably
    # faster message digest algorithm and only the few bytes of its output
    # need to be signed using the slower public key algorithm. To validate
    # the integrity of a signed document, it suffices to re-compute the hash
    # and verify that it is equal to that in the signature.
    # 
    # Among the supported message digest algorithms are:
    # * SHA, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512
    # * MD2, MD4, MDC2 and MD5
    # * RIPEMD160
    # * DSS, DSS1 (Pseudo algorithms to be used for DSA signatures. DSS is
    #   equal to SHA and DSS1 is equal to SHA1)
    # 
    # For each of these algorithms, there is a sub-class of Digest that
    # can be instantiated as simply as e.g.
    # 
    #   digest = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1.new
    # 
    # === Mapping between Digest class and sn/ln
    # 
    # The sn (short names) and ln (long names) are defined in
    # <openssl/object.h> and <openssl/obj_mac.h>. They are textual
    # representations of ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIERs. Each supported digest
    # algorithm has an OBJECT IDENTIFIER associated to it and those again
    # have short/long names assigned to them.
    # E.g. the OBJECT IDENTIFIER for SHA-1 is 1.3.14.3.2.26 and its
    # sn is "SHA1" and its ln is "sha1".
    # ==== MD2
    # * sn: MD2
    # * ln: md2
    # ==== MD4
    # * sn: MD4
    # * ln: md4
    # ==== MD5
    # * sn: MD5
    # * ln: md5
    # ==== SHA
    # * sn: SHA
    # * ln: SHA
    # ==== SHA-1
    # * sn: SHA1
    # * ln: sha1
    # ==== SHA-224
    # * sn: SHA224
    # * ln: sha224
    # ==== SHA-256
    # * sn: SHA256
    # * ln: sha256
    # ==== SHA-384
    # * sn: SHA384
    # * ln: sha384
    # ==== SHA-512
    # * sn: SHA512
    # * ln: sha512
    # 
    # "Breaking" a message digest algorithm means defying its one-way
    # function characteristics, i.e. producing a collision or finding a way
    # to get to the original data by means that are more efficient than
    # brute-forcing etc. Most of the supported digest algorithms can be
    # considered broken in this sense, even the very popular MD5 and SHA1
    # algorithms. Should security be your highest concern, then you should
    # probably rely on SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 or SHA512.

    #   data = File.read('document')

    # Provides password-based encryption functionality based on PKCS#5.
    # Typically used for securely deriving arbitrary length symmetric keys
    # to be used with an OpenSSL::Cipher from passwords. Another use case
    # is for storing passwords: Due to the ability to tweak the effort of
    # computation by increasing the iteration count, computation can be
    # slowed down artificially in order to render possible attacks infeasible.
    # 
    # PKCS5 offers support for PBKDF2 with an OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1-based
    # HMAC, or an arbitrary Digest if the underlying version of OpenSSL
    # already supports it (>= 0.9.4).
    # 
    # === Parameters
    # ==== Password
    # Typically an arbitrary String that represents the password to be used
    # for deriving a key.
    # ==== Salt
    # Prevents attacks based on dictionaries of common passwords. It is a
    # public value that can be safely stored along with the password (e.g.
    # if PBKDF2 is used for password storage). For maximum security, a fresh,
    # random salt should be generated for each stored password. According
    # to PKCS#5, a salt should be at least 8 bytes long.
    # ==== Iteration Count
    # Allows to tweak the length that the actual computation will take. The
    # larger the iteration count, the longer it will take.
    # ==== Key Length
    # Specifies the length in bytes of the output that will be generated.
    # Typically, the key length should be larger than or equal to the output
    # length of the underlying digest function, otherwise an attacker could
    # simply try to brute-force the key. According to PKCS#5, security is
    # limited by the output length of the underlying digest function, i.e.
    # security is not improved if a key length strictly larger than the
    # digest output length is chosen. Therefore, when using PKCS5 for
    # password storage, it suffices to store values equal to the digest
    # output length, nothing is gained by storing larger values.
    # 
    # == Examples
    # === Generating a 128 bit key for a Cipher (e.g. AES)
    #   pass = "secret"
    #   salt = OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes(16)
    #   iter = 20000
    #   key_len = 16
    #   key = OpenSSL::PKCS5.pbkdf2_hmac_sha1(pass, salt, iter, key_len)
    # 
    # === Storing Passwords
    #   pass = "secret"
    #   salt = OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes(16) #store this with the generated value
    #   iter = 20000
    #   digest = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256.new
    #   len = digest.digest_length
    #   #the final value to be stored
    #   value = OpenSSL::PKCS5.pbkdf2_hmac(pass, salt, iter, len, digest)
    # 
    # === Important Note on Checking Passwords
    # When comparing passwords provided by the user with previously stored
    # values, a common mistake made is comparing the two values using "==".
    # Typically, "==" short-circuits on evaluation, and is therefore
    # vulnerable to timing attacks. The proper way is to use a method that
    # always takes the same amount of time when comparing two values, thus
    # not leaking any information to potential attackers. To compare two
    # values, the following could be used:
    #   def eql_time_cmp(a, b)
    #     unless a.length == b.length
    #       return false
    #     end

    #       result |= c ^ cmp[i]
    #     }
    #     result == 0
    #   end
    # Please note that the premature return in case of differing lengths
    # typically does not leak valuable information - when using PKCS#5, the
    # length of the values to be compared is of fixed size.

    # == Asymmetric Public Key Algorithms
    # 
    # Asymmetric public key algorithms solve the problem of establishing and
    # sharing secret keys to en-/decrypt messages. The key in such an
    # algorithm consists of two parts: a public key that may be distributed
    # to others and a private key that needs to remain secret.
    # 
    # Messages encrypted with a public key can only be encrypted by
    # recipients that are in possession of the associated private key.
    # Since public key algorithms are considerably slower than symmetric
    # key algorithms (cf. OpenSSL::Cipher) they are often used to establish
    # a symmetric key shared between two parties that are in possession of
    # each other's public key.
    # 
    # Asymmetric algorithms offer a lot of nice features that are used in a
    # lot of different areas. A very common application is the creation and
    # validation of digital signatures. To sign a document, the signatory
    # generally uses a message digest algorithm (cf. OpenSSL::Digest) to
    # compute a digest of the document that is then encrypted (i.e. signed)
    # using the private key. Anyone in possession of the public key may then
    # verify the signature by computing the message digest of the original
    # document on their own, decrypting the signature using the signatory's
    # public key and comparing the result to the message digest they
    # previously computed. The signature is valid if and only if the
    # decrypted signature is equal to this message digest.
    # 
    # The PKey module offers support for three popular public/private key
    # algorithms:
    # * RSA (OpenSSL::PKey::RSA)
    # * DSA (OpenSSL::PKey::DSA)
    # * Elliptic Curve Cryptography (OpenSSL::PKey::EC)
    # Each of these implementations is in fact a sub-class of the abstract
    # PKey class which offers the interface for supporting digital signatures
    # in the form of PKey#sign and PKey#verify.
    # 
    # == Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
    # 
    # Finally PKey also features OpenSSL::PKey::DH, an implementation of
    # the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol based on discrete logarithms
    # in finite fields, the same basis that DSA is built on.
    # The Diffie-Hellman protocol can be used to exchange (symmetric) keys
    # over insecure channels without needing any prior joint knowledge
    # between the participating parties. As the security of DH demands
    # relatively long "public keys" (i.e. the part that is overtly
    # transmitted between participants) DH tends to be quite slow. If
    # security or speed is your primary concern, OpenSSL::PKey::EC offers
    # another implementation of the Diffie-Hellman protocol.
    module PKey
        # OpenSSL::PKey.read(string [, pwd ] ) -> PKey
        # OpenSSL::PKey.read(file [, pwd ]) -> PKey
        #  
        # === Parameters
        # * +string+ is a DER- or PEM-encoded string containing an arbitrary private
        # or public key.
        # * +file+ is an instance of +File+ containing a DER- or PEM-encoded
        # arbitrary private or public key.

        # Implementation of an X.509 certificate as specified in RFC 5280.
        # Provides access to a certificate's attributes and allows certificates
        # to be read from a string, but also supports the creation of new
        # certificates from scratch.
        # 
        # === Reading a certificate from a file
        # 
        # Certificate is capable of handling DER-encoded certificates and
        # certificates encoded in OpenSSL's PEM format.
        # 
        #   raw = File.read "cert.cer" # DER- or PEM-encoded
        #   certificate = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new raw
        # 
        # === Saving a certificate to a file
        # 
        # A certificate may be encoded in DER format
        # 
        #   cert = ...
        #   File.open("cert.cer", "wb") { |f| f.print cert.to_der }
        # 
        # or in PEM format
        # 
        #   cert = ...
        #   File.open("cert.pem", "wb") { |f| f.print cert.to_pem }
        # 
        # X.509 certificates are associated with a private/public key pair,
        # typically a RSA, DSA or ECC key (see also OpenSSL::PKey::RSA,
        # OpenSSL::PKey::DSA and OpenSSL::PKey::EC), the public key itself is
        # stored within the certificate and can be accessed in form of an
        # OpenSSL::PKey. Certificates are typically used to be able to associate
        # some form of identity with a key pair, for example web servers serving
        # pages over HTTPs use certificates to authenticate themselves to the user.
        # 
        # The public key infrastructure (PKI) model relies on trusted certificate
        # authorities ("root CAs") that issue these certificates, so that end
        # users need to base their trust just on a selected few authorities
        # that themselves again vouch for subordinate CAs issuing their
        # certificates to end users.
        # 
        # The OpenSSL::X509 module provides the tools to set up an independent
        # PKI, similar to scenarios where the 'openssl' command line tool is
        # used for issuing certificates in a private PKI.
        # 
        # === Creating a root CA certificate and an end-entity certificate
        # 
        # First, we need to create a "self-signed" root certificate. To do so,
        # we need to generate a key first. Please note that the choice of "1"
        # as a serial number is considered a security flaw for real certificates.
        # Secure choices are integers in the two-digit byte range and ideally
        # not sequential but secure random numbers, steps omitted here to keep
        # the example concise.
        # 
        #   root_key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new 2048 # the CA's public/private key
        #   root_ca = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new
        #   root_ca.version = 2 # cf. RFC 5280 - to make it a "v3" certificate
        #   root_ca.serial = 1
        #   root_ca.subject = OpenSSL::X509::Name.parse "/DC=org/DC=ruby-lang/CN=Ruby CA"
        #   root_ca.issuer = root_ca.subject # root CA's are "self-signed"
        #   root_ca.public_key = root_key.public_key
        #   root_ca.not_before = Time.now
        #   root_ca.not_after = root_ca.not_before + 2 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 # 2 years validity
        #   ef = OpenSSL::X509::ExtensionFactory.new
        #   ef.subject_certificate = root_ca

        # The X509 certificate store holds trusted CA certificates used to verify
        # peer certificates.
        # 
        # The easiest way to create a useful certificate store is:
        # 
        #   cert_store = OpenSSL::X509::Store.new
        #   cert_store.set_default_paths
        # 
        # This will use your system's built-in certificates.
        # 
        # If your system does not have a default set of certificates you can
        # obtain a set from Mozilla here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html
        # (Note that this set does not have an HTTPS download option so you may
        # wish to use the firefox-db2pem.sh script to extract the certificates
        # from a local install to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.)
        # 
        # After downloading or generating a cacert.pem from the above link you
        # can create a certificate store from the pem file like this:
        # 
        #   cert_store = OpenSSL::X509::Store.new
        #   cert_store.add_file 'cacert.pem'

        # 
        #   ssl_context = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext.new
        #   ssl_context.cert_store = cert_store
        #
