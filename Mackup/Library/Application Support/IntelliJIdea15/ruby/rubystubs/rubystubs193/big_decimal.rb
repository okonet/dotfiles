# 
# = Introduction
# 
# Ruby provides built-in support for arbitrary precision integer arithmetic.
# For example:
# 
# 42**13   ->   1265437718438866624512
# 
# BigDecimal provides similar support for very large or very accurate floating
# point numbers.
# 
# Decimal arithmetic is also useful for general calculation, because it
# provides the correct answers people expect--whereas normal binary floating
# point arithmetic often introduces subtle errors because of the conversion
# between base 10 and base 2. For example, try:
# 
#   sum = 0
#   for i in (1..10000)
#     sum = sum + 0.0001
#   end
#   print sum
# 
# and contrast with the output from:
# 
#   require 'bigdecimal'
# 
#   sum = BigDecimal.new("0")
#   for i in (1..10000)
#     sum = sum + BigDecimal.new("0.0001")
#   end
#   print sum
# 
# Similarly:
# 
# (BigDecimal.new("1.2") - BigDecimal("1.0")) == BigDecimal("0.2") -> true
# 
# (1.2 - 1.0) == 0.2 -> false
# 
# = Special features of accurate decimal arithmetic
# 
# Because BigDecimal is more accurate than normal binary floating point
# arithmetic, it requires some special values.
# 
# == Infinity
# 
# BigDecimal sometimes needs to return infinity, for example if you divide
# a value by zero.
# 
# BigDecimal.new("1.0") / BigDecimal.new("0.0")  -> infinity
# 
# BigDecimal.new("-1.0") / BigDecimal.new("0.0")  -> -infinity
# 
# You can represent infinite numbers to BigDecimal using the strings
# 'Infinity', '+Infinity' and '-Infinity' (case-sensitive)
# 
# == Not a Number
# 
# When a computation results in an undefined value, the special value NaN
# (for 'not a number') is returned.
# 
# Example:
# 
# BigDecimal.new("0.0") / BigDecimal.new("0.0") -> NaN
# 
# You can also create undefined values.  NaN is never considered to be the
# same as any other value, even NaN itself:
# 
# n = BigDecimal.new('NaN')
# 
# n == 0.0 -> nil
# 
# n == n -> nil
# 
# == Positive and negative zero
# 
# If a computation results in a value which is too small to be represented as
# a BigDecimal within the currently specified limits of precision, zero must
# be returned.
# 
# If the value which is too small to be represented is negative, a BigDecimal
# value of negative zero is returned. If the value is positive, a value of
# positive zero is returned.
# 
# BigDecimal.new("1.0") / BigDecimal.new("-Infinity") -> -0.0
# 
# BigDecimal.new("1.0") / BigDecimal.new("Infinity") -> 0.0
# 
# (See BigDecimal.mode for how to specify limits of precision.)
# 
# Note that -0.0 and 0.0 are considered to be the same for the purposes of
# comparison.
# 
# Note also that in mathematics, there is no particular concept of negative
# or positive zero; true mathematical zero has no sign.
