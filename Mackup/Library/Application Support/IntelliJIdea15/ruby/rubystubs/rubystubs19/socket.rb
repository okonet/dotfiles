# Document-class: ::Socket < BasicSocket
# 
# Class +Socket+ provides access to the underlying operating system
# socket implementations. It can be used to provide more operating system
# specific functionality than the protocol-specific socket classes.
# 
# The constants defined under Socket::Constants are also defined under Socket.
# For example, Socket::AF_INET is usable as well as Socket::Constants::AF_INET.
# See Socket::Constants for the list of constants.
# 
# === Exception Handling
# Ruby's implementation of +Socket+ causes an exception to be raised
# based on the error generated by the system dependent implementation.
# This is why the methods are documented in a way that isolate
# Unix-based system exceptions from Windows based exceptions. If more
# information on particular exception is needed please refer to the
# Unix manual pages or the Windows WinSock reference.
# 
# === Convenient methods
# 
# Although the general way to create socket is Socket.new,
# there are several methods for socket creation for most cases.
# 
# * TCP client socket: Socket.tcp, TCPSocket.open
# * TCP server socket: Socket.tcp_server_loop, TCPServer.open
# * UNIX client socket: Socket.unix, UNIXSocket.open
# * UNIX server socket: Socket.unix_server_loop, UNIXServer.open
# 
# === Documentation by

class Socket < BasicSocket
    # Socket.new(domain, socktype [, protocol]) => socket
    #  
    # Creates a new socket object.
    # 
    # _domain_ should be a communications domain such as: :INET, :INET6, :UNIX, etc.
    # 
    # _socktype_ should be a socket type such as: :STREAM, :DGRAM, :RAW, etc.
    # 
    # _protocol_ should be a protocol defined in the domain.
    # This is optional.
    # If it is not given, 0 is used internally.
    # 
    #   Socket.new(:INET, :STREAM) # TCP socket
    #   Socket.new(:INET, :DGRAM)  # UDP socket
    #   Socket.new(:UNIX, :STREAM) # UNIX stream socket
    #   Socket.new(:UNIX, :DGRAM)  # UNIX datagram socket
    def self.new(p1, p2, p3 = v3)
        #This is a stub, used for indexing
    end
    # socket.connect(remote_sockaddr) => 0
    #  
    # Requests a connection to be made on the given +remote_sockaddr+. Returns 0 if
    # successful, otherwise an exception is raised.
    # 
    # === Parameter
    # * +remote_sockaddr+ - the +struct+ sockaddr contained in a string or Addrinfo object
    # 
    # === Example:
    #      # Pull down Google's web page
    #      require 'socket'
    #      include Socket::Constants
    #      socket = Socket.new( AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0 )
    #      sockaddr = Socket.pack_sockaddr_in( 80, 'www.google.com' )
    #      socket.connect( sockaddr )
    #      socket.write( "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" )
    #      results = socket.read
    # 
    # === Unix-based Exceptions
    # On unix-based systems the following system exceptions may be raised if
    # the call to _connect_ fails:
    # * Errno::EACCES - search permission is denied for a component of the prefix
    #   path or write access to the +socket+ is denied
    # * Errno::EADDRINUSE - the _sockaddr_ is already in use
    # * Errno::EADDRNOTAVAIL - the specified _sockaddr_ is not available from the
    #   local machine
    # * Errno::EAFNOSUPPORT - the specified _sockaddr_ is not a valid address for
    #   the address family of the specified +socket+

    # * Errno::EFAULT - the _sockaddr_ cannot be accessed
    # * Errno::EHOSTUNREACH - the destination host cannot be reached (probably
    #   because the host is down or a remote router cannot reach it)
    # * Errno::EINPROGRESS - the O_NONBLOCK is set for the +socket+ and the
    #   connection cannot be immediately established; the connection will be
    #   established asynchronously
    # * Errno::EINTR - the attempt to establish the connection was interrupted by
    #   delivery of a signal that was caught; the connection will be established
    #   asynchronously
    # * Errno::EISCONN - the specified +socket+ is already connected
    # * Errno::EINVAL - the address length used for the _sockaddr_ is not a valid
    #   length for the address family or there is an invalid family in _sockaddr_
    # * Errno::ENAMETOOLONG - the pathname resolved had a length which exceeded
    #   PATH_MAX

    #   bound to the specified peer address
    # * Errno::ETIMEDOUT - the attempt to connect time out before a connection
    #   was made.
    # 
    # On unix-based systems if the address family of the calling +socket+ is
    # AF_UNIX the follow exceptions may be raised if the call to _connect_
    # fails:
    # * Errno::EIO - an i/o error occurred while reading from or writing to the
    #   file system
    # * Errno::ELOOP - too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
    #   the pathname in _sockaddr_
    # * Errno::ENAMETOOLLONG - a component of a pathname exceeded NAME_MAX
    #   characters, or an entire pathname exceeded PATH_MAX characters
    # * Errno::ENOENT - a component of the pathname does not name an existing file
    #   or the pathname is an empty string

    # * Errno::EADDRNOTAVAIL - the remote address is not a valid address, such as
    #   ADDR_ANY TODO check ADDRANY TO INADDR_ANY
    # * Errno::EAFNOSUPPORT - addresses in the specified family cannot be used with
    #   with this +socket+
    # * Errno::ECONNREFUSED - the target _sockaddr_ was not listening for connections
    #   refused the connection request
    # * Errno::EFAULT - the socket's internal address or address length parameter
    #   is too small or is not a valid part of the user space address
    # * Errno::EINVAL - the +socket+ is a listening socket

    # 
    # === Unix-based Exceptions
    # On unix-based based systems the following system exceptions may be raised if
    # the call to _bind_ fails:
    # * Errno::EACCES - the specified _sockaddr_ is protected and the current
    #   user does not have permission to bind to it

    # fails:
    # * Errno::EACCES - search permission is denied for a component of the prefix
    #   path or write access to the +socket+ is denied
    # * Errno::EDESTADDRREQ - the _sockaddr_ argument is a null pointer
    # * Errno::EISDIR - same as Errno::EDESTADDRREQ
    # * Errno::EIO - an i/o error occurred
    # * Errno::ELOOP - too many symbolic links were encountered in translating

    # 
    # === Windows Exceptions
    # On Windows systems the following system exceptions may be raised if
    # the call to _bind_ fails:
    # * Errno::ENETDOWN-- the network is down
    # * Errno::EACCES - the attempt to connect the datagram socket to the

    # * Errno::ENOBUFS - no buffer space is available
    # * Errno::ENOTSOCK - the +socket+ argument does not refer to a socket
    # 
    # === See
    # * bind manual pages on unix-based systems
    # * bind function in Microsoft's Winsock functions reference
    def bind(local_sockaddr)
        #This is a stub, used for indexing
    end
    # socket.listen( int ) => 0
    #  
    # Listens for connections, using the specified +int+ as the backlog. A call
    # to _listen_ only applies if the +socket+ is of type SOCK_STREAM or
    # SOCK_SEQPACKET.
    # 
    # === Parameter
    # * +backlog+ - the maximum length of the queue for pending connections.
    # 
    # === Example 1
    #      require 'socket'
    #      include Socket::Constants
    #      socket = Socket.new( AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0 )
    #      sockaddr = Socket.pack_sockaddr_in( 2200, 'localhost' )
    #      socket.bind( sockaddr )
    #      socket.listen( 5 )
    # 
    # === Example 2 (listening on an arbitrary port, unix-based systems only):
    #      require 'socket'
    #      include Socket::Constants
    #      socket = Socket.new( AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0 )
    #      socket.listen( 1 )
    # 
    # === Unix-based Exceptions
    # On unix based systems the above will work because a new +sockaddr+ struct
    # is created on the address ADDR_ANY, for an arbitrary port number as handed
    # off by the kernel. It will not work on Windows, because Windows requires that
    # the +socket+ is bound by calling _bind_ before it can _listen_.
    # 
    # If the _backlog_ amount exceeds the implementation-dependent maximum
    # queue length, the implementation's maximum queue length will be used.
    # 
    # On unix-based based systems the following system exceptions may be raised if the
    # call to _listen_ fails:
    # * Errno::EBADF - the _socket_ argument is not a valid file descriptor
    # * Errno::EDESTADDRREQ - the _socket_ is not bound to a local address, and
    #   the protocol does not support listening on an unbound socket
    # * Errno::EINVAL - the _socket_ is already connected
    # * Errno::ENOTSOCK - the _socket_ argument does not refer to a socket
    # * Errno::EOPNOTSUPP - the _socket_ protocol does not support listen
    # * Errno::EACCES - the calling process does not have appropriate privileges
    # * Errno::EINVAL - the _socket_ has been shut down
    # * Errno::ENOBUFS - insufficient resources are available in the system to
    #   complete the call
    # 
    # === Windows Exceptions
    # On Windows systems the following system exceptions may be raised if
    # the call to _listen_ fails:
    # * Errno::ENETDOWN - the network is down
    # * Errno::EADDRINUSE - the socket's local address is already in use. This
    #   usually occurs during the execution of _bind_ but could be delayed
    #   if the call to _bind_ was to a partially wildcard address (involving
    #   ADDR_ANY) and if a specific address needs to be committed at the
    #   time of the call to _listen_
    # * Errno::EINPROGRESS - a Windows Sockets 1.1 call is in progress or the
    #   service provider is still processing a callback function
    # * Errno::EINVAL - the +socket+ has not been bound with a call to _bind_.
    # * Errno::EISCONN - the +socket+ is already connected
    # * Errno::EMFILE - no more socket descriptors are available
    # * Errno::ENOBUFS - no buffer space is available
    # * Errno::ENOTSOC - +socket+ is not a socket
    # * Errno::EOPNOTSUPP - the referenced +socket+ is not a type that supports
    #   the _listen_ method

    # === Unix-based Exceptions
    # On unix-based based systems the following system exceptions may be raised if the
    # call to _recvfrom_ fails:
    # * Errno::EAGAIN - the +socket+ file descriptor is marked as O_NONBLOCK and no
    #   data is waiting to be received; or MSG_OOB is set and no out-of-band data
    #   is available and either the +socket+ file descriptor is marked as
    #   O_NONBLOCK or the +socket+ does not support blocking to wait for
    #   out-of-band-data
    # * Errno::EWOULDBLOCK - see Errno::EAGAIN
    # * Errno::EBADF - the +socket+ is not a valid file descriptor
    # * Errno::ECONNRESET - a connection was forcibly closed by a peer
    # * Errno::EFAULT - the socket's internal buffer, address or address length
    #   cannot be accessed or written
    # * Errno::EINTR - a signal interrupted _recvfrom_ before any data was available
    # * Errno::EINVAL - the MSG_OOB flag is set and no out-of-band data is available
    # * Errno::EIO - an i/o error occurred while reading from or writing to the
    #   filesystem
    # * Errno::ENOBUFS - insufficient resources were available in the system to
    #   perform the operation
    # * Errno::ENOMEM - insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request
    # * Errno::ENOSR - there were insufficient STREAMS resources available to
    #   complete the operation
    # * Errno::ENOTCONN - a receive is attempted on a connection-mode socket that
    #   is not connected
    # * Errno::ENOTSOCK - the +socket+ does not refer to a socket
    # * Errno::EOPNOTSUPP - the specified flags are not supported for this socket type
    # * Errno::ETIMEDOUT - the connection timed out during connection establishment
    #   or due to a transmission timeout on an active connection
    # 
    # === Windows Exceptions
    # On Windows systems the following system exceptions may be raised if
    # the call to _recvfrom_ fails:
    # * Errno::ENETDOWN - the network is down
    # * Errno::EFAULT - the internal buffer and from parameters on +socket+ are not
    #   part of the user address space, or the internal fromlen parameter is
    #   too small to accommodate the peer address
    # * Errno::EINTR - the (blocking) call was cancelled by an internal call to
    #   the WinSock function WSACancelBlockingCall
    # * Errno::EINPROGRESS - a blocking Windows Sockets 1.1 call is in progress or
    #   the service provider is still processing a callback function
    # * Errno::EINVAL - +socket+ has not been bound with a call to _bind_, or an
    #   unknown flag was specified, or MSG_OOB was specified for a socket with
    #   SO_OOBINLINE enabled, or (for byte stream-style sockets only) the internal
    #   len parameter on +socket+ was zero or negative
    # * Errno::EISCONN - +socket+ is already connected. The call to _recvfrom_ is
    #   not permitted with a connected socket on a socket that is connection
    #   oriented or connectionless.
    # * Errno::ENETRESET - the connection has been broken due to the keep-alive
    #   activity detecting a failure while the operation was in progress.
    # * Errno::EOPNOTSUPP - MSG_OOB was specified, but +socket+ is not stream-style
    #   such as type SOCK_STREAM. OOB data is not supported in the communication
    #   domain associated with +socket+, or +socket+ is unidirectional and
    #   supports only send operations
    # * Errno::ESHUTDOWN - +socket+ has been shutdown. It is not possible to
    #   call _recvfrom_ on a socket after _shutdown_ has been invoked.
    # * Errno::EWOULDBLOCK - +socket+ is marked as nonblocking and a  call to
    #   _recvfrom_ would block.
    # * Errno::EMSGSIZE - the message was too large to fit into the specified buffer
    #   and was truncated.
    # * Errno::ETIMEDOUT - the connection has been dropped, because of a network
    #   failure or because the system on the other end went down without
    #   notice
    # * Errno::ECONNRESET - the virtual circuit was reset by the remote side
    #   executing a hard or abortive close. The application should close the
    #   socket; it is no longer usable. On a UDP-datagram socket this error
    #   indicates a previous send operation resulted in an ICMP Port Unreachable
    #   message.
