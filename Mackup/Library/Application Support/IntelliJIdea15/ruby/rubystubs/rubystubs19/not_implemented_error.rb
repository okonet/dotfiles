# Raised when a feature is not implemented on the current platform. For
# example, methods depending on the +fsync+ or +fork+ system calls may
# raise this exception if the underlying operating system or Ruby
# runtime does not support them.
# 
# Note that if +fork+ raises a +NotImplementedError+, then
# <code>respond_to?(:fork)</code> returns +false+.
