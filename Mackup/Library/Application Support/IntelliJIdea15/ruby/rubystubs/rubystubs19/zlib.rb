    # 
    # The following methods in Zlib::GzipReader are just like their counterparts
    # in IO, but they raise Zlib::Error or Zlib::GzipFile::Error exception if an
    # error was found in the gzip file.
    # - #each
    # - #each_line
    # - #each_byte
    # - #gets
    # - #getc
    # - #lineno
    # - #lineno=
    # - #read
    # - #readchar
    # - #readline
    # - #readlines
    # - #ungetc
    # 
    # Be careful of the footer of the gzip file. A gzip file has the checksum of
    # pre-compressed data in its footer. GzipReader checks all uncompressed data
    # against that checksum at the following cases, and if it fails, raises
    # <tt>Zlib::GzipFile::NoFooter</tt>, <tt>Zlib::GzipFile::CRCError</tt>, or
    # <tt>Zlib::GzipFile::LengthError</tt> exception.
    # 
    # - When an reading request is received beyond the end of file (the end of
    #   compressed data). That is, when Zlib::GzipReader#read,
    #   Zlib::GzipReader#gets, or some other methods for reading returns nil.
    # - When Zlib::GzipFile#close method is called after the object reaches the
    #   end of file.
    # - When Zlib::GzipReader#unused method is called after the object reaches
    #   the end of file.
    # 
    # The rest of the methods are adequately described in their own
    # documentation.

    # Zlib::ZStream is the abstract class for the stream which handles the
    # compressed data. The operations are defined in the subclasses:
    # Zlib::Deflate for compression, and Zlib::Inflate for decompression.
    # 
    # An instance of Zlib::ZStream has one stream (struct zstream in the source)
    # and two variable-length buffers which associated to the input (next_in) of
    # the stream and the output (next_out) of the stream. In this document,
    # "input buffer" means the buffer for input, and "output buffer" means the
    # buffer for output.
    # 
    # Data input into an instance of Zlib::ZStream are temporally stored into
    # the end of input buffer, and then data in input buffer are processed from
    # the beginning of the buffer until no more output from the stream is
    # produced (i.e. until avail_out > 0 after processing).  During processing,
    # output buffer is allocated and expanded automatically to hold all output
    # data.
    # 
    # Some particular instance methods consume the data in output buffer and
    # return them as a String.
    # 
    # Here is an ascii art for describing above:
