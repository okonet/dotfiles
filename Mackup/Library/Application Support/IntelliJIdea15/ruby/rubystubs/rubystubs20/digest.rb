# This module provides a framework for message digest libraries.
# 
# You may want to look at OpenSSL::Digest as it supports support more
# algorithms.
# 
# A cryptographic hash function is a procedure that takes data and return a
# fixed bit string : the hash value, also known as _digest_. Hash functions
# are also called one-way functions, it is easy to compute a digest from
# a message, but it is infeasible to generate a message from a digest.
# 
# == Example
# 
#   require 'digest'
# 
#   # Compute a complete digest
#   sha256 = Digest::SHA256.new
#   digest = sha256.digest message
# 
#   # Compute digest by chunks
#   sha256 = Digest::SHA256.new
#   sha256.update message1
#   sha256 << message2 # << is an alias for update
# 
#   digest = sha256.digest
# 
# == Digest algorithms
# 
# Different digest algorithms (or hash functions) are available :
# 
# HMAC::
#   See FIPS PUB 198 The Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
# RIPEMD-160::
#   (as Digest::RMD160) see
#   http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bosselae/ripemd160.html
# SHA1::
#   See FIPS 180 Secure Hash Standard
# SHA2 family::
#   See FIPS 180 Secure Hash Standard which defines the following algorithms:
#   * SHA512
#   * SHA384
#   * SHA256
# 
# The latest versions of the FIPS publications can be found here:
# http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html
# 
# Additionally Digest::BubbleBabble encodes a digest as a sequence of
# consonants and vowels which is more recognizable and comparable than a
# hexadecimal digest.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubblebabble
