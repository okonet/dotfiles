# A class that provides the functionality of Kernel#set_trace_func in a
# nice Object-Oriented API.
# 
# == Example
# 
# We can use TracePoint to gather information specifically for exceptions:
# 
#      trace = TracePoint.new(:raise) do |tp|
#          p [tp.lineno, tp.event, tp.raised_exception]
#      end
#      #=> #<TracePoint:0x007f786a452448>
# 
#      trace.enable
#      #=> #<TracePoint:0x007f786a452448>
# 
#      0 / 0
#      #=> [5, :raise, #<ZeroDivisionError: divided by 0>]
# 
# == Events
# 
# If you don't specify the type of events you want to listen for,
# TracePoint will include all available events.
# 
# *Note* do not depend on current event set, as this list is subject to
# change. Instead, it is recommended you specify the type of events you
# want to use.
# 
# To filter what is traced, you can pass any of the following as +events+:
# 
# +:line+:: execute code on a new line
# +:class+:: start a class or module definition
# +:end+:: finish a class or module definition
# +:call+:: call a Ruby method
# +:return+:: return from a Ruby method
# +:c_call+:: call a C-language routine
# +:c_return+:: return from a C-language routine
# +:raise+:: raise an exception
# +:b_call+:: event hook at block entry
# +:b_return+:: event hook at block ending
# +:thread_begin+:: event hook at thread beginning
# +:thread_end+:: event hook at thread ending
class TracePoint
    # TracePoint.new(*events) { |obj| block }          -> obj
    #  
    # Returns a new TracePoint object, not enabled by default.
    # 
    # Next, in order to activate the trace, you must use TracePoint.enable
    # 
    #      trace = TracePoint.new(:call) do |tp|
    #          p [tp.lineno, tp.defined_class, tp.method_id, tp.event]
    #      end
    #      #=> #<TracePoint:0x007f17372cdb20>
    #

    # 
    #      trace.disable
    # 
    # See TracePoint@Events for possible events and more information.
    # 
    # A block must be given, otherwise a ThreadError is raised.
    # 
    # If the trace method isn't included in the given events filter, a
    # RuntimeError is raised.
