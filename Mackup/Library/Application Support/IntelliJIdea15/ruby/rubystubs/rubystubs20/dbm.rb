# Documented by mathew meta@pobox.com.
# = Introduction
# 
# The DBM class provides a wrapper to a Unix-style
# {dbm}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dbm] or Database Manager library.
# 
# Dbm databases do not have tables or columns; they are simple key-value
# data stores, like a Ruby Hash except not resident in RAM. Keys and values
# must be strings.
# 
# The exact library used depends on how Ruby was compiled. It could be any
# of the following:
# 
# - The original ndbm library is released in 4.3BSD.
#   It is based on dbm library in Unix Version 7 but has different API to
#   support multiple databases in a process.
# - {Berkeley DB}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_DB] versions
#   1 thru 5, also known as BDB and Sleepycat DB, now owned by Oracle
#   Corporation.
# - Berkeley DB 1.x, still found in 4.4BSD derivatives (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc).
# - {gdbm}[http://www.gnu.org/software/gdbm/], the GNU implementation of dbm.
# - {qdbm}[http://fallabs.com/qdbm/index.html], another open source
#   reimplementation of dbm.
# 
# All of these dbm implementations have their own Ruby interfaces
# available, which provide richer (but varying) APIs.
# 
# = Cautions
# 
# Before you decide to use DBM, there are some issues you should consider:
# 
# - Each implementation of dbm has its own file format. Generally, dbm
#   libraries will not read each other's files. This makes dbm files
#   a bad choice for data exchange.
# 
# - Even running the same OS and the same dbm implementation, the database
#   file format may depend on the CPU architecture. For example, files may
#   not be portable between PowerPC and 386, or between 32 and 64 bit Linux.
# 
# - Different versions of Berkeley DB use different file formats. A change to
#   the OS may therefore break DBM access to existing files.
# 
# - Data size limits vary between implementations. Original Berkeley DB was
#   limited to 2GB of data. Dbm libraries also sometimes limit the total
#   size of a key/value pair, and the total size of all the keys that hash
#   to the same value. These limits can be as little as 512 bytes. That said,
#   gdbm and recent versions of Berkeley DB do away with these limits.
# 
# Given the above cautions, DBM is not a good choice for long term storage of
# important data. It is probably best used as a fast and easy alternative
# to a Hash for processing large amounts of data.
# 
# = Example
# 
#  require 'dbm'
#  db = DBM.open('rfcs', 666, DBM::CREATRW)
#  db['822'] = 'Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages'
#  db['1123'] = 'Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support'
#  db['3068'] = 'An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers'
#  puts db['822']
