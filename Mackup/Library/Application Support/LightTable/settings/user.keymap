;; User keymap
;; -----------------------------
;; Keymaps are stored as a set of diffs that are merged together to create
;; the final set of keys. You can modify these diffs to either add or
;; subtract bindings.
;;
;; Like behaviors, keys are bound by tag. When objects with those tags are active
;; the key bindings are live. Keys can be bound to any number of Light Table commands,
;; allowing you the flexibility to execute multiple operations together. To see a list
;; of all the commands you can execute, start typing a word related to the thing you
;; want to do in between the square brackets (e.g. type "editor").
