# Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object.
# 
# Array indexing starts at 0, as in C or Java.  A negative index is assumed
# to be relative to the end of the array---that is, an index of -1 indicates
# the last element of the array, -2 is the next to last element in the
# array, and so on.
# 
# == Creating Arrays
# 
# A new array can be created by using the literal constructor
# <code>[]</code>.  Arrays can contain different types of objects.  For
# example, the array below contains an Integer, a String and a Float:
# 
#    ary = [1, "two", 3.0] #=> [1, "two", 3.0]
# 
# An array can also be created by explicitly calling Array.new with zero, one
# (the initial size of the Array) or two arguments (the initial size and a
# default object).
# 
#    ary = Array.new    #=> []
#    Array.new(3)       #=> [nil, nil, nil]
#    Array.new(3, true) #=> [true, true, true]
# 
# Note that the second argument populates the array with references to the
# same object.  Therefore, it is only recommended in cases when you need to
# instantiate arrays with natively immutable objects such as Symbols,
# numbers, true or false.
# 
# To create an array with separate objects a block can be passed instead.
# This method is safe to use with mutable objects such as hashes, strings or
# other arrays:
# 
#    Array.new(4) { Hash.new } #=> [{}, {}, {}, {}]
# 
# This is also a quick way to build up multi-dimensional arrays:
# 
#    empty_table = Array.new(3) { Array.new(3) }
#    #=> [[nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil]]
# 
# An array can also be created by using the Array() method, provided by
# Kernel, which tries to call #to_ary, then #to_a on its argument.
# 
#     Array({:a => "a", :b => "b"}) #=> [[:a, "a"], [:b, "b"]]
# 
# == Example Usage
# 
# In addition to the methods it mixes in through the Enumerable module, the
# Array class has proprietary methods for accessing, searching and otherwise
# manipulating arrays.
# 
# Some of the more common ones are illustrated below.
# 
# == Accessing Elements
# 
# Elements in an array can be retrieved using the Array#[] method.  It can
# take a single integer argument (a numeric index), a pair of arguments
# (start and length) or a range. Negative indices start counting from the end,
# with -1 being the last element.
# 
#    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#    arr[2]    #=> 3
#    arr[100]  #=> nil
#    arr[-3]   #=> 4
#    arr[2, 3] #=> [3, 4, 5]
#    arr[1..4] #=> [2, 3, 4, 5]
#    arr[1..-3] #=> [2, 3, 4]
# 
# Another way to access a particular array element is by using the #at method
# 
#    arr.at(0) #=> 1
# 
# The #slice method works in an identical manner to Array#[].
# 
# To raise an error for indices outside of the array bounds or else to
# provide a default value when that happens, you can use #fetch.
# 
#    arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
#    arr.fetch(100) #=> IndexError: index 100 outside of array bounds: -6...6
#    arr.fetch(100, "oops") #=> "oops"
# 
# The special methods #first and #last will return the first and last
# elements of an array, respectively.
# 
#    arr.first #=> 1
#    arr.last  #=> 6
# 
# To return the first +n+ elements of an array, use #take
# 
#    arr.take(3) #=> [1, 2, 3]
# 
# #drop does the opposite of #take, by returning the elements after +n+
# elements have been dropped:
# 
#    arr.drop(3) #=> [4, 5, 6]
# 
# == Obtaining Information about an Array
# 
# Arrays keep track of their own length at all times.  To query an array
# about the number of elements it contains, use #length, #count or #size.
# 
#   browsers = ['Chrome', 'Firefox', 'Safari', 'Opera', 'IE']
#   browsers.length #=> 5
#   browsers.count #=> 5
# 
# To check whether an array contains any elements at all
# 
#   browsers.empty? #=> false
# 
# To check whether a particular item is included in the array
# 
#   browsers.include?('Konqueror') #=> false
# 
# == Adding Items to Arrays
# 
# Items can be added to the end of an array by using either #push or #<<
# 
#   arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
#   arr.push(5) #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#   arr << 6    #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# 
# #unshift will add a new item to the beginning of an array.
# 
#    arr.unshift(0) #=> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# 
# With #insert you can add a new element to an array at any position.
# 
#    arr.insert(3, 'apple')  #=> [0, 1, 2, 'apple', 3, 4, 5, 6]
# 
# Using the #insert method, you can also insert multiple values at once:
# 
#    arr.insert(3, 'orange', 'pear', 'grapefruit')
#    #=> [0, 1, 2, "orange", "pear", "grapefruit", "apple", 3, 4, 5, 6]
# 
# == Removing Items from an Array
# 
# The method #pop removes the last element in an array and returns it:
# 
#    arr =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#    arr.pop #=> 6
#    arr #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# 
# To retrieve and at the same time remove the first item, use #shift:
# 
#    arr.shift #=> 1
#    arr #=> [2, 3, 4, 5]
# 
# To delete an element at a particular index:
# 
#    arr.delete_at(2) #=> 4
#    arr #=> [2, 3, 5]
# 
# To delete a particular element anywhere in an array, use #delete:
# 
#    arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]
#    arr.delete(2) #=> 2
#    arr #=> [1,3]
# 
# A useful method if you need to remove +nil+ values from an array is
# #compact:
# 
#    arr = ['foo', 0, nil, 'bar', 7, 'baz', nil]
#    arr.compact  #=> ['foo', 0, 'bar', 7, 'baz']
#    arr          #=> ['foo', 0, nil, 'bar', 7, 'baz', nil]
#    arr.compact! #=> ['foo', 0, 'bar', 7, 'baz']
#    arr          #=> ['foo', 0, 'bar', 7, 'baz']
# 
# Another common need is to remove duplicate elements from an array.
# 
# It has the non-destructive #uniq, and destructive method #uniq!
# 
#    arr = [2, 5, 6, 556, 6, 6, 8, 9, 0, 123, 556]
#    arr.uniq #=> [2, 5, 6, 556, 8, 9, 0, 123]
# 
# == Iterating over Arrays
# 
# Like all classes that include the Enumerable module, Array has an each
# method, which defines what elements should be iterated over and how.  In
# case of Array's #each, all elements in the Array instance are yielded to
# the supplied block in sequence.
# 
# Note that this operation leaves the array unchanged.
# 
#    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#    arr.each { |a| print a -= 10, " " }
#    # prints: -9 -8 -7 -6 -5
#    #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# 
# Another sometimes useful iterator is #reverse_each which will iterate over
# the elements in the array in reverse order.
# 
#    words = %w[first second third fourth fifth sixth]
#    str = ""
#    words.reverse_each { |word| str += "#{word} " }
#    p str #=> "sixth fifth fourth third second first "
# 
# The #map method can be used to create a new array based on the original
# array, but with the values modified by the supplied block:
# 
#    arr.map { |a| 2*a }   #=> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
#    arr                   #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#    arr.map! { |a| a**2 } #=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
#    arr                   #=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
# 
# == Selecting Items from an Array
# 
# Elements can be selected from an array according to criteria defined in a
# block.  The selection can happen in a destructive or a non-destructive
# manner.  While the destructive operations will modify the array they were
# called on, the non-destructive methods usually return a new array with the
# selected elements, but leave the original array unchanged.
# 
# === Non-destructive Selection
# 
#    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#    arr.select { |a| a > 3 }     #=> [4, 5, 6]
#    arr.reject { |a| a < 3 }     #=> [3, 4, 5, 6]
#    arr.drop_while { |a| a < 4 } #=> [4, 5, 6]
#    arr                          #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# 
# === Destructive Selection
# 
# #select! and #reject! are the corresponding destructive methods to #select
# and #reject
# 
# Similar to #select vs. #reject, #delete_if and #keep_if have the exact
# opposite result when supplied with the same block:
# 
#    arr.delete_if { |a| a < 4 } #=> [4, 5, 6]
#    arr                         #=> [4, 5, 6]
# 
#    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#    arr.keep_if { |a| a < 4 } #=> [1, 2, 3]
#    arr                       #=> [1, 2, 3]

    #  
    # Tries to convert +obj+ into an array, using +to_ary+ method.  Returns the
    # converted array or +nil+ if +obj+ cannot be converted for any reason.
    # This method can be used to check if an argument is an array.
    # 
    #    Array.try_convert([1])   #=> [1]
    #    Array.try_convert("1")   #=> nil
    # 
    #    if tmp = Array.try_convert(arg)

    # Array.new(size=0, default=nil)
    # Array.new(array)
    # Array.new(size) {|index| block }
    #  
    # Returns a new array.
    # 
    # In the first form, if no arguments are sent, the new array will be empty.
    # When a +size+ and an optional +default+ are sent, an array is created with
    # +size+ copies of +default+.  Take notice that all elements will reference the
    # same object +default+.
    # 
    # The second form creates a copy of the array passed as a parameter (the
    # array is generated by calling to_ary on the parameter).
    # 
    #   first_array = ["Matz", "Guido"]
    # 
    #   second_array = Array.new(first_array) #=> ["Matz", "Guido"]
    # 
    #   first_array.equal? second_array       #=> false
    # 
    # In the last form, an array of the given size is created.  Each element in
    # this array is created by passing the element's index to the given block
    # and storing the return value.
    # 
    #   Array.new(3){ |index| index ** 2 }
    #   # => [0, 1, 4]
    # 
    # == Common gotchas
    # 
    # When sending the second parameter, the same object will be used as the
    # value for all the array elements:
    # 
    #    a = Array.new(2, Hash.new)
    #    # => [{}, {}]
    # 
    #    a[0]['cat'] = 'feline'
    #    a # => [{"cat"=>"feline"}, {"cat"=>"feline"}]
    # 
    #    a[1]['cat'] = 'Felix'
    #    a # => [{"cat"=>"Felix"}, {"cat"=>"Felix"}]
    # 
    # Since all the Array elements store the same hash, changes to one of them
    # will affect them all.
    # 
    # If multiple copies are what you want, you should use the block
    # version which uses the result of that block each time an element
    # of the array needs to be initialized:
    # 
    #    a = Array.new(2) { Hash.new }
    #    a[0]['cat'] = 'feline'
    #    a # => [{"cat"=>"feline"}, {}]

    # elements to convert. If the count is an asterisk

    # converted. Any of the directives ``<code>sSiIlL</code>'' may be
    # followed by an underscore (``<code>_</code>'') or
    # exclamation mark (``<code>!</code>'') to use the underlying
    # platform's native size for the specified type; otherwise, they use a
    # platform-independent size. Spaces are ignored in the template
    # string. See also <code>String#unpack</code>.
