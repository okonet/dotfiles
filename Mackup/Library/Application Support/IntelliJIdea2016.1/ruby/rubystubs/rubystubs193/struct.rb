# A <code>Struct</code> is a convenient way to bundle a number of
# attributes together, using accessor methods, without having to write
# an explicit class.
# 
# The <code>Struct</code> class is a generator of specific classes,
# each one of which is defined to hold a set of variables and their
# accessors. In these examples, we'll call the generated class
# ``<i>Customer</i>Class,'' and we'll show an example instance of that
# class as ``<i>Customer</i>Inst.''
# 
# In the descriptions that follow, the parameter <i>symbol</i> refers
# to a symbol, which is either a quoted string or a
# <code>Symbol</code> (such as <code>:name</code>).
class Struct
    include Enumerable
    # Struct.new( [aString] [, aSym]+> )    -> StructClass
    # StructClass.new(arg, ...)             -> obj
    # StructClass[arg, ...]                 -> obj
    #  
    # Creates a new class, named by <i>aString</i>, containing accessor
    # methods for the given symbols. If the name <i>aString</i> is
    # omitted, an anonymous structure class will be created. Otherwise,
    # the name of this struct will appear as a constant in class
    # <code>Struct</code>, so it must be unique for all
    # <code>Struct</code>s in the system and should start with a capital
    # letter. Assigning a structure class to a constant effectively gives
    # the class the name of the constant.
    # 
    # <code>Struct::new</code> returns a new <code>Class</code> object,
    # which can then be used to create specific instances of the new
    # structure. The number of actual parameters must be
    # less than or equal to the number of attributes defined for this
    # class; unset parameters default to <code>nil</code>.  Passing too many
    # parameters will raise an <code>ArgumentError</code>.
    # 
    # The remaining methods listed in this section (class and instance)
    # are defined for this generated class.
