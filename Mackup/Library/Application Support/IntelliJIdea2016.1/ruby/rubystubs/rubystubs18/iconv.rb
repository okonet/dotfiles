# ::BrokenLibrary
# 
# Detected a bug of underlying iconv(3) libray.
# * returns an error without setting errno properly
class Iconv < Data
    # Iconv.open(to, from) { |iconv| ... }
    #  
    # Equivalent to Iconv.new except that when it is called with a block, it
    # yields with the new instance and closes it, and returns the result which
    # returned from the block.
    def self.open(to, from)
        #This is a stub, used for indexing
    end
    # Iconv.iconv(to, from, *strs)
    #  
    # Shorthand for
    #   Iconv.open(to, from) { |cd|
    #     (strs + [nil]).collect { |s| cd.iconv(s) }
    #   }
    # 
    # === Parameters
    # 
    # <tt>to, from</tt>:: see Iconv.new
    # <tt>strs</tt>:: strings to be converted
    # 
    # === Exceptions
    # 
    # Exceptions thrown by Iconv.new, Iconv.open and Iconv#iconv.
    def self.iconv(to, from, *strs)
        #This is a stub, used for indexing
    end
    # Iconv.conv(to, from, str)
    #  
    # Shorthand for
    #   Iconv.iconv(to, from, str).join
    # See Iconv.iconv.
    def self.conv(to, from, str)
        #This is a stub, used for indexing
    end
    # Iconv.new(to, from)
    #  
    # Creates new code converter from a coding-system designated with +from+
    # to another one designated with +to+.
    # 
    # === Parameters
    # 
    # +to+::   encoding name for destination
    # +from+:: encoding name for source
    # 
    # === Exceptions
    # 
    # TypeError::       if +to+ or +from+ aren't String
    # InvalidEncoding:: if designated converter couldn't find out
    # SystemCallError:: if <tt>iconv_open(3)</tt> fails
    def self.new(to, from)
        #This is a stub, used for indexing
    end
    # Finishes conversion.
    # 
    # After calling this, calling Iconv#iconv will cause an exception, but
    # multiple calls of #close are guaranteed to end successfully.
    # 
    # Returns a string containing the byte sequence to change the output buffer to
    # its initial shift state.
    def close()
        #This is a stub, used for indexing
    end
    # iconv(str, start=0, length=-1)
    #  
    # Converts string and returns the result.
    # * If +str+ is a String, converts <tt>str[start, length]</tt> and returns the converted string.
    # * If +str+ is +nil+, places converter itself into initial shift state and
    #   just returns a string containing the byte sequence to change the output
    #   buffer to its initial shift state.
    # * Otherwise, raises an exception.
    # 
    # === Parameters
    # 
    # str::    string to be converted, or nil
    # start::  starting offset
    # length:: conversion length; nil or -1 means whole the string from start
    # 
    # === Exceptions
    # 
    # * IconvIllegalSequence
    # * IconvInvalidCharacter
    # * IconvOutOfRange
    # 
    # === Examples
    # 
    # See the Iconv documentation.
