# The IO class is the basis for all input and output in Ruby.
# An I/O stream may be <em>duplexed</em> (that is, bidirectional), and
# so may use more than one native operating system stream.
# 
# Many of the examples in this section use the File class, the only standard
# subclass of IO. The two classes are closely associated.  Like the File
# class, the Socket library subclasses from IO (such as TCPSocket or
# UDPSocket).
# 
# The Kernel#open method can create an IO (or File) object for these types
# of arguments:
# 
# * A plain string represents a filename suitable for the underlying
#   operating system.
# 
# * A string starting with <code>"|"</code> indicates a subprocess.
#   The remainder of the string following the <code>"|"</code> is
#   invoked as a process with appropriate input/output channels
#   connected to it.
# 
# * A string equal to <code>"|-"</code> will create another Ruby
#   instance as a subprocess.
# 
# The IO may be opened with different file modes (read-only, write-only) and
# encodings for proper conversion.  See IO.new for these options.  See
# Kernel#open for details of the various command formats described above.
# 
# IO.popen, the Open3 library, or  Process#spawn may also be used to
# communicate with subprocesses through an IO.
# 
# Ruby will convert pathnames between different operating system
# conventions if possible.  For instance, on a Windows system the
# filename <code>"/gumby/ruby/test.rb"</code> will be opened as
# <code>"\gumby\ruby\test.rb"</code>.  When specifying a Windows-style
# filename in a Ruby string, remember to escape the backslashes:
# 
#   "c:\\gumby\\ruby\\test.rb"
# 
# Our examples here will use the Unix-style forward slashes;
# File::ALT_SEPARATOR can be used to get the platform-specific separator
# character.
# 
# The global constant ARGF (also accessible as $<) provides an
# IO-like stream which allows access to all files mentioned on the
# command line (or STDIN if no files are mentioned). ARGF#path and its alias
# ARGF#filename are provided to access the name of the file currently being
# read.
# 
# == io/console
# 
# The io/console extension provides methods for interacting with the
# console.  The console can be accessed from IO.console or the standard
# input/output/error IO objects.
# 
# Requiring io/console adds the following methods:
# 
# * IO::console
# * IO#raw
# * IO#raw!
# * IO#cooked
# * IO#cooked!
# * IO#getch
# * IO#echo=
# * IO#echo?
# * IO#noecho
# * IO#winsize
# * IO#winsize=
# * IO#iflush
# * IO#ioflush
# * IO#oflush
# 
# Example:
# 
#   require 'io/console'
#   rows, columns = $stdin.winsize
#   puts "Your screen is #{columns} wide and #{rows} tall"

    # Calls select(2) system call.
    # It monitors given arrays of <code>IO</code> objects, waits one or more
    # of <code>IO</code> objects ready for reading, are ready for writing,
    # and have pending exceptions respectively, and returns an array that
    # contains arrays of those IO objects.  It will return <code>nil</code>
    # if optional <i>timeout</i> value is given and no <code>IO</code> object
    # is ready in <i>timeout</i> seconds.
    # 
    # <code>IO.select</code> peeks the buffer of <code>IO</code> objects for testing readability.
    # If the <code>IO</code> buffer is not empty,
    # <code>IO.select</code> immediately notify readability.
    # This "peek" is only happen for <code>IO</code> objects.
    # It is not happen for IO-like objects such as OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.
    # 
    # The best way to use <code>IO.select</code> is invoking it
    # after nonblocking methods such as <code>read_nonblock</code>, <code>write_nonblock</code>, etc.
    # The methods raises an exception which is extended by
    # <code>IO::WaitReadable</code> or <code>IO::WaitWritable</code>.
    # The modules notify how the caller should wait with <code>IO.select</code>.
    # If <code>IO::WaitReadable</code> is raised, the caller should wait for reading.
    # If <code>IO::WaitWritable</code> is raised, the caller should wait for writing.
    # 
    # So, blocking read (<code>readpartial</code>) can be emulated using
    # <code>read_nonblock</code> and <code>IO.select</code> as follows:
    # 
    #   begin
    #     result = io_like.read_nonblock(maxlen)
    #   rescue IO::WaitReadable
    #     IO.select([io_like])
    #     retry
    #   rescue IO::WaitWritable
    #     IO.select(nil, [io_like])
    #     retry
    #   end
    # 
    # Especially, the combination of nonblocking methods and
    # <code>IO.select</code> is preferred for <code>IO</code> like
    # objects such as <code>OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket</code>.
    # It has <code>to_io</code> method to return underlying <code>IO</code> object.
    # <code>IO.select</code> calls <code>to_io</code> to obtain the file descriptor to wait.
    # 
    # This means that readability notified by <code>IO.select</code> doesn't mean
    # readability from <code>OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket</code> object.
    # 
    # Most possible situation is <code>OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket</code> buffers some data.
    # <code>IO.select</code> doesn't see the buffer.
    # So <code>IO.select</code> can block when <code>OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#readpartial</code> doesn't block.
    # 
    # However several more complicated situation exists.
    # 
    # SSL is a protocol which is sequence of records.
    # The record consists multiple bytes.
    # So, the remote side of SSL sends a partial record,
    # <code>IO.select</code> notifies readability but
    # <code>OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket</code> cannot decrypt a byte and
    # <code>OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#readpartial</code> will blocks.
    # 
    # Also, the remote side can request SSL renegotiation which forces
    # the local SSL engine writes some data.
    # This means <code>OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#readpartial</code> may
    # invoke <code>write</code> system call and it can block.
    # In such situation, <code>OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#read_nonblock</code>
    # raises IO::WaitWritable instead of blocking.
    # So, the caller should wait for ready for writability as above example.
    # 
    # The combination of nonblocking methods and <code>IO.select</code> is
    # also useful for streams such as tty, pipe socket socket when
    # multiple process read form a stream.
    # 
    # Finally, Linux kernel developers doesn't guarantee that
    # readability of select(2) means readability of following read(2) even
    # for single process.
    # See select(2) manual on GNU/Linux system.
    # 
    # Invoking <code>IO.select</code> before <code>IO#readpartial</code> works well in usual.
    # However it is not the best way to use <code>IO.select</code>.
    # 
    # The writability notified by select(2) doesn't show
    # how many bytes writable.
    # <code>IO#write</code> method blocks until given whole string is written.
    # So, <code>IO#write(two or more bytes)</code> can block after writability is notified by <code>IO.select</code>.
    # <code>IO#write_nonblock</code> is required to avoid the blocking.
    # 
    # Blocking write (<code>write</code>) can be emulated using
    # <code>write_nonblock</code> and <code>IO.select</code> as follows:
    # IO::WaitReadable should also be rescued for SSL renegotiation in <code>OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket</code>.
    # 
    #   while 0 < string.bytesize
    #     begin
    #       written = io_like.write_nonblock(string)
    #     rescue IO::WaitReadable
    #       IO.select([io_like])
    #       retry
    #     rescue IO::WaitWritable
    #       IO.select(nil, [io_like])
    #       retry
    #     end
    #     string = string.byteslice(written..-1)

    # the read string is converted from encoding A (external encoding)
    # to encoding B (internal encoding), then tagged with B.

    # IO.new(fd [, mode] [, opt])   -> io
    #  
    # Returns a new IO object (a stream) for the given integer file descriptor
    # +fd+ and +mode+ string.  +opt+ may be used to specify parts of +mode+ in a
    # more readable fashion.  See also IO.sysopen and IO.for_fd.
    # 
    # IO.new is called by various File and IO opening methods such as IO::open,
    # Kernel#open, and File::open.
    # 
    # === Open Mode
    # 
    # When +mode+ is an integer it must be combination of the modes defined in
    # File::Constants (+File::RDONLY+, +File::WRONLY | File::CREAT+).  See the
    # open(2) man page for more information.
    # 
    # When +mode+ is a string it must be in one of the following forms:
    # 
    #   fmode
    #   fmode ":" ext_enc
    #   fmode ":" ext_enc ":" int_enc
    #   fmode ":" "BOM|UTF-*"
    # 
    # +fmode+ is an IO open mode string, +ext_enc+ is the external encoding for
    # the IO and +int_enc+ is the internal encoding.
    # 
    # ==== IO Open Mode
    # 
    # Ruby allows the following open modes:
    # 
    #     "r"  Read-only, starts at beginning of file  (default mode).
    # 
    #     "r+" Read-write, starts at beginning of file.
    # 
    #     "w"  Write-only, truncates existing file
    #          to zero length or creates a new file for writing.
    # 
    #     "w+" Read-write, truncates existing file to zero length
    #          or creates a new file for reading and writing.
    # 
    #     "a"  Write-only, starts at end of file if file exists,
    #          otherwise creates a new file for writing.
    # 
    #     "a+" Read-write, starts at end of file if file exists,
    #          otherwise creates a new file for reading and
    #          writing.
    # 
    # The following modes must be used separately, and along with one or more of
    # the modes seen above.
    # 
    #     "b"  Binary file mode
    #          Suppresses EOL <-> CRLF conversion on Windows. And
    #          sets external encoding to ASCII-8BIT unless explicitly
    #          specified.
    # 
    #     "t"  Text file mode
    # 
    # When the open mode of original IO is read only, the mode cannot be
    # changed to be writable.  Similarly, the open mode cannot be changed from
    # write only to readable.
    # 
    # When such a change is attempted the error is raised in different locations
    # according to the platform.
    # 
    # === IO Encoding
    # 
    # When +ext_enc+ is specified, strings read will be tagged by the encoding
    # when reading, and strings output will be converted to the specified
    # encoding when writing.
    # 
    # When +ext_enc+ and +int_enc+ are specified read strings will be converted
    # from +ext_enc+ to +int_enc+ upon input, and written strings will be
    # converted from +int_enc+ to +ext_enc+ upon output.  See Encoding for
    # further details of transcoding on input and output.
    # 
    # If "BOM|UTF-8", "BOM|UTF-16LE" or "BOM|UTF16-BE" are used, ruby checks for
    # a Unicode BOM in the input document to help determine the encoding.  For
    # UTF-16 encodings the file open mode must be binary.  When present, the BOM
    # is stripped and the external encoding from the BOM is used.  When the BOM
    # is missing the given Unicode encoding is used as +ext_enc+.  (The BOM-set
    # encoding option is case insensitive, so "bom|utf-8" is also valid.)
    # 
    # === Options
    # 
    # +opt+ can be used instead of +mode+ for improved readability.  The
    # following keys are supported:
    # 
    # :mode ::
    #   Same as +mode+ parameter
    # 
    # :\external_encoding ::
    #   External encoding for the IO.  "-" is a synonym for the default external
    #   encoding.
    # 
    # :\internal_encoding ::
    #   Internal encoding for the IO.  "-" is a synonym for the default internal
    #   encoding.
    # 
    #   If the value is nil no conversion occurs.
    # 
    # :encoding ::
    #   Specifies external and internal encodings as "extern:intern".
    # 
    # :textmode ::
    #   If the value is truth value, same as "t" in argument +mode+.
    # 
    # :binmode ::
    #   If the value is truth value, same as "b" in argument +mode+.
    # 
    # :autoclose ::
    #   If the value is +false+, the +fd+ will be kept open after this IO
    #   instance gets finalized.
    # 
    # Also, +opt+ can have same keys in String#encode for controlling conversion
    # between the external encoding and the internal encoding.
    # 
    # === Example 1
    # 
    #   fd = IO.sysopen("/dev/tty", "w")
    #   a = IO.new(fd,"w")
    #   $stderr.puts "Hello"
    #   a.puts "World"
    # 
    # Produces:
    # 
    #   Hello
    #   World
    # 
    # === Example 2
    # 
    #   require 'fcntl'
    # 
    #   fd = STDERR.fcntl(Fcntl::F_DUPFD)
    #   io = IO.new(fd, mode: 'w:UTF-16LE', cr_newline: true)
    #   io.puts "Hello, World!"
    # 
    #   fd = STDERR.fcntl(Fcntl::F_DUPFD)
    #   io = IO.new(fd, mode: 'w', cr_newline: true,
    #               external_encoding: Encoding::UTF_16LE)
    #   io.puts "Hello, World!"
    # 
    # Both of above print "Hello, World!" in UTF-16LE to standard error output
    # with converting EOL generated by <code>puts</code> to CR.
