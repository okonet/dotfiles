# Coverage provides coverage measurement feature for Ruby.
# This feature is experimental, so these APIs may be changed in future.
# 
# = Usage
# 
# 1. require "coverage.so"
# 2. do Coverage.start
# 3. require or load Ruby source file
# 4. Coverage.result will return a hash that contains filename as key and
#    coverage array as value. A coverage array gives, for each line, the
#    number of line execution by the interpreter. A +nil+ value means
#    coverage is disabled for this line (lines like +else+ and +end+).
# 
# = Example
# 
#   [foo.rb]
#   s = 0
#   10.times do |x|
#     s += x
#   end
# 
#   if s == 45
#     p :ok
#   else
#     p :ng
#   end
#   [EOF]
# 
#   require "coverage.so"
#   Coverage.start
#   require "foo.rb"
#   p Coverage.result  #=> {"foo.rb"=>[1, 1, 10, nil, nil, 1, 1, nil, 0, nil]}
module Coverage
    # Coverage.start  => nil

    end
    # Coverage.result  => hash
    #  
    # Returns a hash that contains filename as key and coverage array as value
    # and disables coverage measurement.
    def self.result()
        #This is a stub, used for indexing
