# The Etc module provides access to information typically stored in
# files in the /etc directory on Unix systems.
# 
# The information accessible consists of the information found in the
# /etc/passwd and /etc/group files, plus information about the system's
# temporary directory (/tmp) and configuration directory (/etc).
# 
# The Etc module provides a more reliable way to access information about
# the logged in user than environment variables such as +$USER+.
# 
# == Example:
# 
#     require 'etc'
# 
#     login = Etc.getlogin
#     info = Etc.getpwnam(login)
#     username = info.gecos.split(/,/).first
#     puts "Hello #{username}, I see your login name is #{login}"
# 
# Note that the methods provided by this module are not always secure.
# It should be used for informational purposes, and not for security.
# 
# All operations defined in this module are class methods, so that you can
# include the Etc module into your class.
module Etc
    # account expiration time(integer) must be compiled with +HAVE_ST_PW_EXPIRE+
    Passwd = nil #value is unknown, used for indexing.
    # is an Array of Strings containing the short login names of the
    #      members of the group.
    Group = nil #value is unknown, used for indexing.
    # getlogin     ->  String
    #  
    # Returns the short user name of the currently logged in user.
    # Unfortunately, it is often rather easy to fool ::getlogin.
    # 
    # Avoid ::getlogin for security-related purposes.
    # 
    # If ::getlogin fails, try ::getpwuid.
    # 
    # See the unix manpage for <code>getpwuid(3)</code> for more detail.
    # 
    # e.g.
    #   Etc.getlogin -> 'guest'
    def self.getlogin()
        #This is a stub, used for indexing
    end
    # getpwuid(uid)        ->  Passwd
    #  
    # Returns the /etc/passwd information for the user with the given integer +uid+.
    # 
    # The information is returned as a Passwd struct.
    # 
    # If +uid+ is omitted, the value from <code>Passwd[:uid]</code> is returned
    # instead.
    # 
    # See the unix manpage for <code>getpwuid(3)</code> for more detail.
    # 
    # === Example:
    # 
    #      Etc.getpwuid(0)
    #      #=> #<struct Struct::Passwd name="root", passwd="x", uid=0, gid=0, gecos="root",dir="/root", shell="/bin/bash">

    # +name+.
    # 
    # The information is returned as a Passwd struct.
    # 
    # See the unix manpage for <code>getpwnam(3)</code> for more detail.
    # 
    # === Example:
    # 
    #      Etc.getpwnam('root')
