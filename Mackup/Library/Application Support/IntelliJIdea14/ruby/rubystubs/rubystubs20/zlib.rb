# This module provides access to the {zlib library}[http://zlib.net]. Zlib is
# designed to be a portable, free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered --
# that is, not covered by any patents -- lossless data-compression library
# for use on virtually any computer hardware and operating system.
# 
# The zlib compression library provides in-memory compression and
# decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed
# data.
# 
# The zlib compressed data format is described in RFC 1950, which is a
# wrapper around a deflate stream which is described in RFC 1951.
# 
# The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
# with an interface similar to that of IO. The gzip format is described in
# RFC 1952 which is also a wrapper around a deflate stream.
# 
# The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory and on
# communications channels. The gzip format was designed for single-file
# compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
# directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.
# 
# See your system's zlib.h for further information about zlib
# 
# == Sample usage
# 
# Using the wrapper to compress strings with default parameters is quite
# simple:
# 
#   require "zlib"
# 
#   data_to_compress = File.read("don_quixote.txt")
# 
#   puts "Input size: #{data_to_compress.size}"
#   #=> Input size: 2347740
# 
#   data_compressed = Zlib::Deflate.deflate(data_to_compress)
# 
#   puts "Compressed size: #{data_compressed.size}"
#   #=> Compressed size: 887238
# 
#   uncompressed_data = Zlib::Inflate.inflate(data_compressed)
# 
#   puts "Uncompressed data is: #{uncompressed_data}"
#   #=> Uncompressed data is: The Project Gutenberg EBook of Don Quixote...

        # 
        # The +mem_level+ specifies how much memory should be allocated for the
        # internal compression state.  1 uses minimum memory but is slow and reduces
        # compression ratio while 9 uses maximum memory for optimal speed.  The

    # == Method Catalogue
    # 
    # The following methods in Zlib::GzipReader are just like their counterparts
    # in IO, but they raise Zlib::Error or Zlib::GzipFile::Error exception if an
    # error was found in the gzip file.
    # - #each
    # - #each_line
    # - #each_byte
    # - #gets
    # - #getc
    # - #lineno
    # - #lineno=
    # - #read
    # - #readchar
    # - #readline
    # - #readlines
    # - #ungetc
    # 
    # Be careful of the footer of the gzip file. A gzip file has the checksum of
    # pre-compressed data in its footer. GzipReader checks all uncompressed data
    # against that checksum at the following cases, and if it fails, raises
    # <tt>Zlib::GzipFile::NoFooter</tt>, <tt>Zlib::GzipFile::CRCError</tt>, or
    # <tt>Zlib::GzipFile::LengthError</tt> exception.
    # 
    # - When an reading request is received beyond the end of file (the end of
    #   compressed data). That is, when Zlib::GzipReader#read,
    #   Zlib::GzipReader#gets, or some other methods for reading returns nil.
    # - When Zlib::GzipFile#close method is called after the object reaches the
    #   end of file.
    # - When Zlib::GzipReader#unused method is called after the object reaches
    #   the end of file.
    # 
    # The rest of the methods are adequately described in their own
    # documentation.

    # Zlib::ZStream is the abstract class for the stream which handles the
    # compressed data. The operations are defined in the subclasses:
    # Zlib::Deflate for compression, and Zlib::Inflate for decompression.
    # 
    # An instance of Zlib::ZStream has one stream (struct zstream in the source)
    # and two variable-length buffers which associated to the input (next_in) of
    # the stream and the output (next_out) of the stream. In this document,
    # "input buffer" means the buffer for input, and "output buffer" means the
    # buffer for output.
    # 
    # Data input into an instance of Zlib::ZStream are temporally stored into
    # the end of input buffer, and then data in input buffer are processed from
    # the beginning of the buffer until no more output from the stream is
    # produced (i.e. until avail_out > 0 after processing).  During processing,
    # output buffer is allocated and expanded automatically to hold all output
    # data.
    # 
    # Some particular instance methods consume the data in output buffer and
    # return them as a String.
    # 
    # Here is an ascii art for describing above:

    # subclass of Zlib::Error is raised.  At that time, both input and output
    # buffer keep their conditions at the time when the error occurs.

    # == Method Catalogue
    # 
    # Many of the methods in this class are fairly low-level and unlikely to be
    # of interest to users.  In fact, users are unlikely to use this class
    # directly; rather they will be interested in Zlib::Inflate and
    # Zlib::Deflate.
    # 
    # The higher level methods are listed below.

    # - #adler
