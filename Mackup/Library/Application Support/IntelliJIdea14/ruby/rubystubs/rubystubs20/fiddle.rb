# A libffi wrapper for Ruby.
# 
# == Description
# 
# Fiddle is an extension to translate a foreign function interface (FFI)
# with ruby.
# 
# It wraps {libffi}[http://sourceware.org/libffi/], a popular C library
# which provides a portable interface that allows code written in one
# language to clal code written in another language.
# 
# == Example
# 
# Here we will use Fiddle::Function to wrap {floor(3) from
# libm}[http://linux.die.net/man/3/floor]
# 
#      require 'fiddle'
# 
#      libm = Fiddle.dlopen('/lib/libm.so.6')
# 
#      floor = Fiddle::Function.new(
#        libm['floor'],
#        [Fiddle::TYPE_DOUBLE],
#        Fiddle::TYPE_DOUBLE
#      )
# 
#      puts floor.call(3.14159) #=> 3.0
