    # The InstructionSequence class represents a compiled sequence of
    # instructions for the Ruby Virtual Machine.
    # 
    # With it, you can get a handle to the instructions that make up a method or
    # a proc, compile strings of Ruby code down to VM instructions, and
    # disassemble instruction sequences to strings for easy inspection. It is
    # mostly useful if you want to learn how the Ruby VM works, but it also lets
    # you control various settings for the Ruby iseq compiler.
    # 
    # You can find the source for the VM instructions in +insns.def+ in the Ruby
    # source.
    # 
    # The instruction sequence results will almost certainly change as Ruby
    # changes, so example output in this documentation may be different from what
    # you see.
