# Many operating systems allow signals to be sent to running
# processes. Some signals have a defined effect on the process, while
# others may be trapped at the code level and acted upon. For
# example, your process may trap the USR1 signal and use it to toggle
# debugging, and may use TERM to initiate a controlled shutdown.
# 
#     pid = fork do
#       Signal.trap("USR1") do
#         $debug = !$debug
#         puts "Debug now: #$debug"
#       end
#       Signal.trap("TERM") do
#         puts "Terminating..."
#         shutdown()
#       end
#       # . . . do some work . . .
#     end
# 
#     Process.detach(pid)
# 
#     # Controlling program:
#     Process.kill("USR1", pid)
#     # ...
#     Process.kill("USR1", pid)
#     # ...
#     Process.kill("TERM", pid)
# 
# produces:
#     Debug now: true
#     Debug now: false
#    Terminating...

# The list of available signal names and their interpretation is
# system dependent. Signal delivery semantics may also vary between
# systems; in particular signal delivery may not always be reliable.
module Signal
    # Signal.trap( signal, command ) -> obj
    # Signal.trap( signal ) {| | block } -> obj
    #  
    # Specifies the handling of signals. The first parameter is a signal
    # name (a string such as ``SIGALRM'', ``SIGUSR1'', and so on) or a
    # signal number. The characters ``SIG'' may be omitted from the
    # signal name. The command or block specifies code to be run when the
    # signal is raised.
    # If the command is the string ``IGNORE'' or ``SIG_IGN'', the signal
    # will be ignored.
    # If the command is ``DEFAULT'' or ``SIG_DFL'', the Ruby's default handler
    # will be invoked.
    # If the command is ``EXIT'', the script will be terminated by the signal.
    # If the command is ``SYSTEM_DEFAULT'', the operating system's default
    # handler will be invoked.
    # Otherwise, the given command or block will be run.
    # The special signal name ``EXIT'' or signal number zero will be
    # invoked just prior to program termination.
    # trap returns the previous handler for the given signal.
    # 
    #     Signal.trap(0, proc { puts "Terminating: #{$$}" })
    #     Signal.trap("CLD")  { puts "Child died" }
    #     fork && Process.wait
    # 
    # produces:
    #     Terminating: 27461
    #     Child died
    #     Terminating: 27460
