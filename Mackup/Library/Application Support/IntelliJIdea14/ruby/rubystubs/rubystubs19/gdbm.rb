# == Summary
# 
# Ruby extension for GNU dbm (gdbm) -- a simple database engine for storing
# key-value pairs on disk.
# 
# == Description
# 
# GNU dbm is a library for simple databases. A database is a file that stores
# key-value pairs. Gdbm allows the user to store, retrieve, and delete data by
# key. It furthermore allows a non-sorted traversal of all key-value pairs.
# A gdbm database thus provides the same functionality as a hash. As
# with objects of the Hash class, elements can be accessed with <tt>[]</tt>.
# Furthermore, GDBM mixes in the Enumerable module, thus providing convenient
# methods such as #find, #collect, #map, etc.
# 
# A process is allowed to open several different databases at the same time.
# A process can open a database as a "reader" or a "writer". Whereas a reader
# has only read-access to the database, a writer has read- and write-access.
# A database can be accessed either by any number of readers or by exactly one
# writer at the same time.
# 
# == Examples
# 
# 1. Opening/creating a database, and filling it with some entries:
# 
#      require 'gdbm'
# 
#      gdbm = GDBM.new("fruitstore.db")
#      gdbm["ananas"]    = "3"
#      gdbm["banana"]    = "8"
#      gdbm["cranberry"] = "4909"
#      gdbm.close
# 
# 2. Reading out a database:
# 
#      require 'gdbm'
# 
#      gdbm = GDBM.new("fruitstore.db")
#      gdbm.each_pair do |key, value|
#        print "#{key}: #{value}\n"
#      end
#      gdbm.close
# 
#    produces
# 
#      banana: 8
#      ananas: 3
#      cranberry: 4909

    # If called without a block, this is synonymous to GDBM::new.
    # If a block is given, the new GDBM instance will be passed to the block
    # as a parameter, and the corresponding database file will be closed
    # after the execution of the block code has been finished.
    # 
    # Example for an open call with a block:
    # 
    #   require 'gdbm'
    #   GDBM.open("fruitstore.db") do |gdbm|
    #     gdbm.each_pair do |key, value|
    #       print "#{key}: #{value}\n"

        #This is a stub, used for indexing
    end
    # GDBM.new(filename, mode = 0666, flags = nil)
    #  
    # Creates a new GDBM instance by opening a gdbm file named _filename_.
    # If the file does not exist, a new file with file mode _mode_ will be
    # created. _flags_ may be one of the following:
    # * *READER*  - open as a reader
    # * *WRITER*  - open as a writer
    # * *WRCREAT* - open as a writer; if the database does not exist, create a new one
    # * *NEWDB*   - open as a writer; overwrite any existing databases
    # 
    # The values *WRITER*, *WRCREAT* and *NEWDB* may be combined with the following
    # values by bitwise or:
    # * *SYNC*    - cause all database operations to be synchronized to the disk
    # * *NOLOCK*  - do not lock the database file
    # 
    # If no _flags_ are specified, the GDBM object will try to open the database
    # file as a writer and will create it if it does not already exist
    # (cf. flag <tt>WRCREAT</tt>). If this fails (for instance, if another process
    # has already opened the database as a reader), it will try to open the
    # database file as a reader (cf. flag <tt>READER</tt>).
