The <strong>HTML External Resource Link element (<code>&lt;link&gt;</code>)</strong> specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS">stylesheets</a>, but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.
